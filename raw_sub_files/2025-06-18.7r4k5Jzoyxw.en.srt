1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,120
Plane at 185 heading away. Let me

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
randomly shoot him and see if I get his

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,360
attention. That just hit. I just hit. Or

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,360
you can just absolutely nail his wing.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,320
Gunter driver. He's all yours, Bo.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,039
I cast follow-up shot.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
Thank you. Also, that's really bad.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,240
That's like worst case scenario for me.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,720
There's a greater wizard here than you,

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,359
Bo. I'm traumatized. Me, too.

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,160
Are we clear otherwise? I I guess so.

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
Stick's here. Hi, Stick. Hi. Plane's

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
coming back. Coming back. It's coming

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
back. It's coming back. No. No. It

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
lights me. I'm the chosen. That counts.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,760
I claimed that kill. I point at my

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
monitor, too. That's not how that works.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
I am such a good target. He had to come

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
back. I was desirable. He liked you a

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,280
little too much. Hey, it doesn't happen

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
often for me. Okay, let me have it. You

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,559
ever fall into these traps on YouTube

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,199
where you uh see these videos that are

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:05,040
like this 5x5 wood shed was built in

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,200
1785 and was used and this this and this

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
and it's like a four or five hour video

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,439
and I'll just sit there the entire time

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,920
fascinated by just a random history of

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,200
some structure that's been abandoned for

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
60 years. Actually, I do the same thing

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,720
cuz I have a couple of structures in my

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,960
town. the abandoned Six Flags videos.

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,360
I've watched all of them.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,360
I am a really big fan of uh the uh urban

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,759
explorers that go to abandoned places

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,280
and like, you know, they respect the

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
area. They don't vandalize everything,

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
but they are just kind of walking around

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,439
maybe a place they shouldn't be. But

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,200
it's really cool to see like malls and

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,040
stuff that like haven't been used in 20

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,399
years. I found this video that talks

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
about animatronics. I can't remember the

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,040
channel's name, but he went on a big

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
Chuck-E-Cheese deep dive and there was

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
this one ride that's like a I say ride,

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
but you know, like the helicopter thing

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
you used to go up to the ceiling and

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,719
back down. It's just a video of him

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,399
trying to figure out what that was

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:06,799
called. Really? I watched all of it.

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
Something wrong with me? No, cuz I was

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,520
about to bring up something else that's

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
cursed about Chuck-E-Cheese. Did you

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
know that there's a really really like

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
welldetailed authentic old school

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Chuck-E-Cheese in VR chat? That's very

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,239
heavily populated. Of course, you know

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
that. It's really weird. I was also

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
going to mention that same channel did

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,280
performance reviews of all the different

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
characters on Chuck-E-Cheese and how

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
much effort talent they have. Oh god. I

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,480
am so sorry. I just saw I was thinking

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,160
about Oh my god. Same. I'm sorry. Here

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
you go. Go forwards. I'm just going to

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,200
go forwards. That way you can go that

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,040
way. Oh well. I guess I'm going forward.

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello. Thinking about that awful cheese

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,480
pizza that's cardboard.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,519
possibly reheated. You want to You want

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,440
to know a weird thing?

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,760
Oh, the tank that's in front of Jim that

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,040
just took him. Oh, boy. That I just

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
stared at and blankly thought about

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
cheese pizza. I'm realizing I should

77
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,400
probably say something or shoot him.

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,120
It's okay. I stared at him, too. I'm

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,519
hungry. I'm sorry. Growing up, I thought

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
Chuck-E-Cheese had the best pizza. Cuz

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,560
you're a kid and you're just happy to

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,120
have pizza. Yeah. You don't know any

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,080
better. What an awkward way to greet

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,720
someone. S there's one in front and uh

85
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
behind me through there. Okay. Yep.

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,599
Coming up behind the one that I've got

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
the one that's behind you. I'm just

88
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,720
going to keep driving cuz he's behind

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
me.

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,000
Yep. Yep. Keep driving.

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,400
I'll circle back when I can.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
Nice kill.

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
One behind you. I hear I hear sounds. I

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,080
hear sounds. We need to recap. A by the

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,680
way.

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
American tank on A. I'm sorry. I have to

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
pick what street I go down.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Actually, you might be pushing me.

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
Hello. You're not an American. Uh, hang

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,200
in there if you can. I'm sorry. Not the

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,920
greatest vehicle to respond with.

102
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,120
Uh, bad news. Are you winning? No. And

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,080
he shot. I'm sorry.

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,560
T34. He's left. I saw his exhaust

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,560
towards the point.

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,000
He's just right there. He's down. Yo,

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,360
look at that cool old bus next to you.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm over here looking for tanks. And Jim

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
is looking at transportation vehicles.

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,879
You're so excited for Transport Fever 3,

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
aren't you? I really am, actually. I

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,840
They better have all my my sweetheart

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,479
locomotives and trucks and buses there.

114
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,960
Maccados and what else do you like? Uh

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,120
the New Haven EP5 electric locomotive.

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,880
I've activated something inside of him.

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,680
Uh the uh Pennsylvania GG1.

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,960
Um let's see here. What else do we like?

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
You know, every train person is judging

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
you right now for your answers. I mean,

121
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
it's okay. to each their own.

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,880
I can also start listing off like trucks

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
I like uh you know when you when you

124
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,000
when you get to like the 19 early 1900s.

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,759
Please no. I'm sorry. Two planes. B and

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,919
you go from the Mac truck to an Opal

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
Blitz. Oh, are you still listening? Bo,

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,440
are you still listening? I'm still here.

129
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes. Okay. Yeah. So, like I really like

130
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,919
the Opal Blitz cuz it's actually a very

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
versatile truck early game. Yeah, it

132
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,919
gets kind of weird in the 1930s, but but

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,560
you know, we won't talk about that. Fell

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,400
with some bad people.

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah. Yeah. I kind of hung out with the

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,520
wrong crowd. Bad crowd in middle school.

137
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
Yeah.

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
I just like how I can keep my favorite

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
vehicles going for like a hundred years.

140
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,600
So like it's the year 2077 and my coal

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,600
train still being pulled by a big boy. I

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,479
love it. I know that's the name of a

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,800
train engine. I know that.

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,320
So the Union Pacific Big Boy was an

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,720
articulated steam locomotive.

146
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,680
It's very big.

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,400
Hey, look. There's an airplane.

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,280
That one's called a Corsair.

149
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
I'm familiar with his work.

150
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,120
Yeah, those were built by a few

151
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,759
different companies, but VA and Goodyear

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,280
are my favorites. Brewster, eh?

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,199
Goodyear.

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
Yeah, Goodyear built planes. Did you

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
know there's an AA here? I took his

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
gunner if you bomb is out. I'm just

157
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,240
going to clear it. Did you know you put

158
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,479
that in his turret? The uh the old

159
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,400
defunct model train uh company called AC

160
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,039
Gilbert during World War II made the

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,199
machine gun parts for the Hellcat.

162
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,479
Okay. Yeah. And then after the war

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
they're like, "Yo, I'm Listen, I'm just

164
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
being shot at. We have really good

165
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,160
tooling to make even better model

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,160
trains."

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
By the way, the entire time I was

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,800
staring at my model train shelf. So, you

169
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
know, the uh there's a conspiracy theory

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
with the AAC. They say they're carbon

171
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
neutral. Actually, they they have a very

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,919
very bad carbon deficit.

173
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,720
The war on this has gotten so deep.

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,960
I also heard the AAC uh would fire

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,000
people for taking excessive uh bathroom

176
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,800
breaks. Okay. Why is the AAC now turning

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
into like a dystopian business? From the

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,919
events of 2020 where a lot of people had

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,440
to work from home at the AAC, there was

180
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,840
some terrible management decisions. And

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,479
now in 2025, the A factory is a very,

182
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,240
very problematic workspace.

183
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,599
I just picture people now typing the

184
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,440
letter A on their keyboards and getting

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,240
paid for it.

186
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,880
That's pretty much what happens.

187
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,720
They have to write them out now. Well,

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
see, that's what they used to do back up

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,560
until about 199. Truck front left.

190
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,639
Truck. Truck. Truck. Rival truck. Truck.

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh god. You got to handle the truck. I

192
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
got the driver in the thing. Sorry. He

193
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,880
was going to die. I was going to say I

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,960
don't have one. I'm not taking

195
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
deliveries. Yeah, neither am I. That was

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,199
his last package to drop off. I'm sorry.

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,880
I'll stop. That's okay. I can't help

198
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
myself. See, now now I don't trust the

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
the vanilla trucks on the map. Look at

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,680
that. Look at that thing just staring at

201
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,720
you menacingly. Uh contact there. It's

202
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,080
short. Maybe stout

203
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,879
and you shake it all about. It's down.

204
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,840
Thank you, Jim. I'm concerned about your

205
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,440
uh leadership right now. Your scouting.

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,240
My sticks in front of me. It's his

207
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,520
fault. It is not my fault. He's got the

208
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,199
battle flag on his tank. He's the

209
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,240
leader.

210
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,840
No. Uh-huh. Yeah, you do. That Yes, I

211
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
have the flag. I'm not contesting the

212
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,319
fact that I have the flag. Jim,

213
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,319
where do we go? Senpai, tell me. I

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
kind of glad I'm slower. Please talk

215
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,400
some sense into him. I don't know if I

216
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
can do that. Hey, how many people are

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
going to get laid off when they realize

218
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,000
you can copy and paste letter A? Oh,

219
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
don't multiple times. Yeah. So, like

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
that's another thing about the the the A

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
factories. They also went down the road

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,440
of NFTTS.

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,919
Special A's.

224
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Yeah. One of a kind A's. Collector A's.

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
Mhm. I have a uh problem over here.

226
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
Also, they're on A. They're on A. We

227
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,680
lost a Jim. Oh, Jim. They've taken over

228
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,320
the factory. Oh, boy. Who's they? The

229
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
letter B. The B

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
gang. I heard the B factory is actually

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,320
quite nice.

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Does the letter B have like a gang sign?

233
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,200
Like is it just holding like two of your

234
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
index and thumbs together? Well, there's

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,880
been some controversy because on the

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
lowercase B side they they install them

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
backwards and they become D's and there

238
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,839
hasn't been a D point in years. Double

239
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
dipping

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,920
there. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Counterfeit

241
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,720
actually. Big problem. The D tank on the

242
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,839
hill. Yes. Oh god. That wall. Never

243
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,560
mind. It's dead. Ignore that statement.

244
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
It's okay. It got me moving. I'm going

245
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,080
to go see what's on the A point. I'm

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,640
going to attempt to scurry up there with

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,120
you. Okay. Uh I think we're going to go

248
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,920
through here. Hey Jim, please pick all

249
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,920
the narrowest options you have. Uh just

250
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
increase my suffering, please. You know

251
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
what? Yeah. Here. Actually, let's try to

252
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
go together. Hold my hand.

253
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,920
What if I go through here and flank? Uh

254
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,519
you may get stuck on that pile of

255
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
rubble.

256
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,959
Might be contact to your left. Uh I

257
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
think you're right. Oh boy. I'll be

258
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,000
around in three business days. Hold me

259
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,240
now. I'm 6 ft from the edge. And he's

260
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,360
singing dead rock.

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Maybe 6 feet isn't so far down. I really

262
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
think you should,

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
you know, have a discussion with him

264
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,800
though.

265
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,800
He's here. Tiger's almost there.

266
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,560
Uh, you might want to mark on the map

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
for him. T34. T34. I'm pushing. Hold on.

268
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,320
Let me mark the map. You got it. I'll

269
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,360
double mark it. Yeah, please do that.

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,519
Thank you. I was like, I'm at the ready.

271
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,800
I might be able to get a shot. Never

272
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,079
mind. He's down. All right, perfect.

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,079
We had him surrounded. We caught the

274
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,079
thief.

275
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,519
You doing okay, buddy?

276
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,279
I think so. Let's check in on you. You

277
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,640
know, the A factory released some really

278
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,560
interesting chemicals and uh I I have to

279
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,440
chemicals. I used to work at the A

280
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,279
factory. Um, what tank right there? I

281
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,800
may be entitled to a settlement. Sorry.

282
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,839
Got it. Thank you. Thank you.

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Do you know what? Uh, tank. I missed the

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,560
shot. Good news. I ate the shot for you.

285
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,360
I looked back just at the right second

286
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,160
to catch that 152 in my face. Oh my

287
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
gosh.

288
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,440
I didn't finish my my lore dump yet of

289
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,560
the downfall of the AAC.

290
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
Jim, what was the downfall of the

291
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,519
Aactory?

292
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,800
It's very controversial.

293
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,040
Did they get bought out by Amazon?

294
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,680
It may be, but Or was it Black Rockck?

295
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,760
Does B stand for Black Rockck?

296
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,120
Actually, I think you're right. I I I

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
remember. If you're deep in the war, A

298
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
is Amazon, B is Black Rockck, who would

299
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,240
C be?

300
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,320
Um,

301
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,959
Polar Coler and uh uh uh

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
Polar and Goldstein there. Totally

303
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,959
legitimate. What is that? A financial

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,440
firm? I never heard of that. Yes. Yes,

305
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,519
it's a financial firm. They're out of uh

306
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
Little Rock, Arkansas. You're making

307
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,560
this up. Absolutely. There's no way.

308
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,839
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,760
Just because you said Little Rock

310
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
financial firm. I knew that was

311
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,279
complete. Well, what do you mean? Little

312
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,320
Rock's the investment capital of the

313
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,160
world. What are you talking about?

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
Arkansas is the venture capitalist

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
capital of the world. That That's what I

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,959
just said. That paid me to say because

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
of words and I'm okay of getting shot

318
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,000
down. Shout out to all my homies in our

319
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
Kansas. I'm going try to squeeze on your

320
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
right here. I'm going to try not to hit

321
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
you. Well, you know how long it's been

322
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,399
since I went to trigonometry.

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,519
Just watch your left and air stick. Oh,

324
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,639
hello. The one front still there. That's

325
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,160
my gunner 86.

326
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,920
Gunner and loader. You got time. Jim,

327
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,399
watch front. Oh, that's good. I'll

328
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,600
finish 18. Okay, go ahead. My right just

329
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,000
got hit. There's a swim down.

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Sherman. Sherman. I'm sorry. That's two

331
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
targets front then.

332
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
I have no visual. I just saw the muzzle

333
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
flash. I'm going to push Jim. I can't

334
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
aim. I'm going to push forward too.

335
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,320
Swarm.

336
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,079
Taliho. There's the Sherman. Thank you.

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
I saw something else down there. He

338
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
might have gone around the flank,

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
though. I'm looking back. Far far.

340
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,639
Transmission's out on you. I'm working

341
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,519
on it. I'm sorry. I don't have a great

342
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,240
line of sight back there. There's a

343
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,880
Sherman in the way. Okay. Can you mark

344
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
it if you see it? Uh, it's it's

345
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,839
somewhere over here. He went around the

346
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,320
corner, right? Oh, I don't know.

347
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,240
Where are you? Come on. Show yourself.

348
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,079
Show yourself. Come on. There he is.

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
He's low. All right. Copy. Sorry. I

350
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,839
thought it went further right. He's

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,399
moving to the left.

352
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,200
I got stuff to my left.

353
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,200
Hopefully all friendlies.

354
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm going to back up a few feet. I have

355
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,560
8 seconds before my transmission's back

356
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,240
in action. I'm trying to watch that gap

357
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,839
there.

358
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
I figured he ran into that building over

359
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,560
there. I'm sorry. No, it's okay. He

360
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
literally shot me, disappeared. I could

361
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,680
not tell where it was from. Left. Oh,

362
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,519
little thing. Left. M18. Left. Through

363
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,959
the tunnel. Through the tunnel. Copy.

364
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,600
Your thing is now pushing forward as

365
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,959
well. That M18 is so surprised.

366
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,959
He has another one in there with him,

367
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,959
too.

368
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
All right, this is becoming slightly

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
horrifying.

370
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,639
You are now alone over there for a bit,

371
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,720
so please be careful. There's also plane

372
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,160
strafing me, so the challenge just

373
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,639
increased. Objective survive. Getting my

374
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,000
gunner back.

375
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
There's one pushing from front still,

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,040
and that's going to be a big issue for

377
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,720
me

378
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,519
cuz I see him just slowly creeping up

379
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,480
through the trees at me.

380
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:40,079
All right, might have a shot. He's down.

381
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:42,399
Nice. Where now? Who is living in here?

382
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,120
That's a jumbo.

383
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,760
Who else wants some? No, please don't.

384
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
I am so

385
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,600
petrified of bombs when I play this

386
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,320
thing.

387
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,000
I just assume every bomb's going for me.

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,680
Oh, they're circling you. I would just

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,040
Yeah, I'm going to hide in here.

390
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,959
I just don't know which side to watch.

391
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,920
Well, good news. If you if you can hold

392
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,560
out for like 30 seconds, you can watch

393
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,399
one side and I can side

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
And if you wait 45 seconds, I'll be

395
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,480
there.

396
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,680
That's too long. Oh, okay. I'm trying.

397
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
It's the effort that matters. I hear

398
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,279
another plane.

399
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm tigering as fast as I can. That

400
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,320
sounds so close. Oh, it's flying

401
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
directly over. It's trying to find me.

402
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
There's two more planes on their side

403
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,600
that are like swooping around and I

404
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
think Okay. Nope. Uh, this is air

405
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,279
traffic control to ground control. Um, I

406
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,480
see three enemy PL. You're getting

407
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,240
strafed. No, I'm inside a tunnel for

408
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
that reason.

409
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
Okay. I thought it was stick. Hello, I'm

410
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,800
here. I was actually going to reload

411
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,160
while I'm sitting here.

412
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,920
So, if I explode, it's a bigger boom.

413
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,360
So, artilleries now. They're dropping

414
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,120
already on me. Yeah, they they want this

415
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,360
thing gone. I was going to ask if you

416
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,399
wanted anything like uh you know, some

417
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,519
snacks or maybe a cold beer.

418
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,880
Can I have a cheeseburger? Uh,

419
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,800
yes. Any bombs? Asking for a friend. Oh,

420
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,920
I got a Zins. Sorry.

421
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,680
I'm going to push out over here a little

422
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,480
bit. Oh my gosh. Stick boy. Yak 9K. You

423
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,440
got Ramure.

424
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,680
Would you like to join me? Jim. Yeah. I

425
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,839
just wanted to live and be. Never mind.

426
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,720
They got me.

427
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,880
Where did that How did they Did he throw

428
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,199
the bomb in the tunnel? I have no idea

429
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,480
at this point. If he did, shout out to

430
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,759
that guy. But also, I'm sorry you're

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,000
dead. I'm shout out the enemy. That was

432
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
impressive. If they if they alley ooped

433
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,079
the bomb into the tunnel, that's kind of

434
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,240
impressive. Say you had like a bounty on

435
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
your head. I'm just watching teammate

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,399
after teammate disappear to airplanes

437
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,399
right now. I I I got killed. The 9K is

438
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,320
just picking people like the Toy Story

439
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,160
crane.

440
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,720
The claw. It's flying right at me.

441
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,720
No, my bomb.

442
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,600
Tragedy.

443
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,600
Please don't judge me. It just has to be

444
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,039
done.

445
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,280
Do your thing. You look like a ski

446
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,400
shooter right now.

447
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,679
I don't have the right shell loaded yet.

448
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,760
Up that one's down. Okay, that's when I

449
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,799
hit the head on.

450
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,080
Plane at 185 heading away. Let me

451
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,120
randomly shoot him and see if I get his

452
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,320
attention. Okay, that just can

453
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,320
absolutely nail his wing.

454
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
I still had AP loaded, too.

455
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,280
Let me just get his attention real

456
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,000
quick. Plane at 320. Totally takes his

457
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,480
entire left wing.

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,919
Stranger danger. Love your toaster.

459
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,559
Workplace. Workplace harassment.

460
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,559
No. Oh, Rook.

461
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:06,080
This got weird, didn't it? Wow. Yeah.

462
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,919
Please love your toaster. No. No.

463
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,679
Please. No. Cherish your toaster. No.

464
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
No. It's bath time. Toasters and baths

465
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,360
don't mix. Why don't you give the

466
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,919
toaster bread anymore? Well, I'm trying

467
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,320
to feed me bread. No, I'm on a keto

468
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,640
diet. Please. No. Keto diet. Carbs are

469
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,080
good for you.

470
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,240
Support your local wheat farmers.

471
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,520
Embrace gluten.

472
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,919
Feed bread.

473
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,160
I bake bread at work, but like not

474
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,480
edible bread.

475
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,799
Talking about money, cash and arrow.

476
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,960
It's time to go. There's a there's a

477
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,679
bomb. Goodbye. If you can point out the

478
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,280
badman hurting you, I'll hurt them back.

479
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,919
Um, is it a Sherman? The sky. Yes, there

480
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,799
there is a Sherman. There's also a T44

481
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,480
behind him. Understood. I'm pushing up.

482
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,320
Those were the main ones. I can get you

483
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
proper spots. One right there. Engine is

484
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
repaired.

485
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
I'd rather take a shot at him. There's

486
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,160
one pushing around this corner a second.

487
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,440
Just be mindful. Yep. I really want that

488
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,000
T44 right there. Marking again.

489
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,000
Actually, that's a T34.

490
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sorry.

491
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,160
Hey, so there's also an IS-2.

492
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,039
Is this an or something?

493
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,120
Interesting. Same spot.

494
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,559
Yeah, they're like next to each other.

495
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,280
All right, push up slowly.

496
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,720
I might only be able to take one. Also,

497
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,720
there's one low right of me charging, so

498
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,799
I choose you, M24.

499
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,280
Oh, hey, stick. Yeah, you didn't tell me

500
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
that uh there was a whole army of them

501
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,880
over here waiting for this opportunity.

502
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,720
Sherman, look out for the Sherman.

503
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
The second I pushed up, they just popped

504
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,960
out from behind like every rock in the

505
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
hill staring at me. I got hit with a

506
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
bomb. I only saw the two. Unfortunately,

507
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,400
they I guess I wasn't good enough for

508
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
all of them to pop out. The best part is

509
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,880
they're all like one to two battle

510
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,240
ratings under what I'm driving. Like the

511
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,840
little tank nation came out.

512
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
I hate when little tank nation comes

513
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,520
out. They're a really strong gang.

514
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,280
They're adorable though. Yeah, but like

515
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,640
they bite.

516
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,640
I took the chaffy over the is

517
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,240
just out of spite. No, it's fine. I Oh,

518
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,679
sorry. I I was given a parking ticket

519
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,200
actually as soon as I spawned. That was

520
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
interesting. Is that what it was? Jim,

521
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,440
would you like me to bomb the things up

522
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,679
here or a

523
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,000
one tank right here? I can take whatever

524
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,440
you need.

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,120
Uh, this guy's getting strafed. I'll

526
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,120
I'll take him. I'll take the silenc.

527
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,280
Thank you. I was trying to see if I

528
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
could see you some spots, but from my

529
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,640
position. No worries. I got a mark for

530
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,120
you. One more back here. X might be

531
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,159
dead.

532
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,159
Um here

533
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,760
and I'll be back in a second. A growing

534
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,360
list of vehicles. I don't like that. If

535
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,360
you see a plane, let me know cuz I'm

536
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,120
staring at ground. All right. One right

537
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,120
here. Oh, there's a plane rolling on

538
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,720
your six. Copy.

539
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,520
He's on He's on your right wing. Does

540
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,080
anybody have machine guns? Uh, nope. I'm

541
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,080
watching you from the grave.

542
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I guess the Yeah, you tried to do the

543
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,240
crossover at Monaco and just hit the the

544
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,600
wall. Monle. Monaco. There we go. I'm

545
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,880
sorry. Stick. I'm going to give this guy

546
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,440
a fight over. He has a fun name.

547
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Oh, that is a name. Mr. Hamster. Uh,

548
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,280
stick high left. Two targets. Yep.

549
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
The one that has to be right there.

550
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,640
Rips. Where is the thing that was? It's

551
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,360
tiny. Right here. That's when it killed

552
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,280
me. Wow. On where I crashed. I'll try

553
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,640
and mark him for you. Okay. Yep.

554
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,000
All right. I can't Oh, my breach is out.

555
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,679
I'm sorry, B. My breach is out. I got

556
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,679
shot in the back. I'm going to take this

557
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,679
guy on the right first. There's one down

558
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
here. Okay. I can't do anything about

559
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
it, unfortunately. You just stay

560
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,960
beautiful. He's right here. Yep. BFW's

561
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,240
got you.

562
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
It's just the little crusader.

563
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,799
Well, I mean, when you don't have a

564
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,000
breach, any tank looks terrifying. I was

565
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,200
going to say, did the crusader bully

566
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,840
you? Yeah, he did. He saw I was myself.

567
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,080
That's my worst nightmare. No, I'm sorry

568
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,559
for making fun of you. No, it's okay. Uh

569
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,720
there I think there's stuff behind me. I

570
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,440
hear things. I hear things that aren't

571
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
us. I'm attempting to run. Okay, I'm

572
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
fixed. Okay. I was panicking so much I

573
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,760
realized my repair ended 4 seconds ago.

574
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
Is there something behind you? We're

575
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,240
getting bombed.

576
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,760
Maybe. Please don't say that. Over here.

577
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
Uh across the valley there was something

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,799
taking shots at me. I don't know if it's

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
still there. So be careful if you want

580
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,880
to come this way. I don't trust it. I'd

581
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,400
like to grab a crew member if possible.

582
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,640
All right, get the crew member. Uh what

583
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,120
way do you want me to look? Which way do

584
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
you think we're going to die from?

585
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Uh I don't know, chief. That's a big

586
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,400
ass. Any guesses?

587
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,720
Like playing Russian. How about from the

588
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,000
sky? Cuz I hear the bomb. No, no, no,

589
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,000
no, no. Oh, it was Are you okay? I'm

590
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
fine. Are you fine? I'm fine. I need

591
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,600
That was an odd noise you made. I need

592
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,760
new trousers, but I'm fine. I can't help

593
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
you with that. Okay. And I won't help

594
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,840
you with that. Right. Here. Do you want

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:29,280
to go find a good friend?

596
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,400
Do you hear the noise over here? Uh Jim,

597
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,039
your engine. The plane is so mean. Leave

598
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,640
him. No, he's dead.

599
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,440
They killed you in front of me in cold

600
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,240
blood. Does someone need some happy

601
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,600
camper repairs?

602
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,600
I don't know if I want to go back to you

603
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,559
or not. I don't want repairs with that

604
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,039
voice.

605
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,480
What was that voice, Jim? Oh, that was

606
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,200
Midwestern uh camp counselor.

607
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,799
Maybe that's why I gave flashbacks.

608
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Gst stick. You got to be more active.

609
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,640
You're not a You're not a good trooper.

610
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,919
Okay, so there's two reasons now I don't

611
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,360
want to join you. One is that boy.

612
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,679
Second, there's artillery landing on you

613
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,840
and I'm in an open top vehicle. I ain't

614
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,279
praying no ghost.

615
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,760
I was reading for artillery hit you

616
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,240
there. Oh my god. But if it did, I would

617
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,919
probably just go outside and probably

618
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,679
have half a pack of cigarettes and then

619
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,919
just I don't know, maybe pull the motor

620
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,600
out of my Lincoln or something. Man

621
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,480
stuff. Man stuff.

622
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,240
But you wouldn't put it back in.

623
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
I can put it back in. It's a 302. It's

624
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,679
really easy. Out in. No, I'm saying you

625
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
just wouldn't. You take it out and just

626
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,279
leave it there for 6 months.

627
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
You know what? You're right.

628
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,840
But he did say it was his Lincoln, not

629
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,320
his project car. So it might get

630
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,559
completed. Every vehicle has this

631
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,039
project. He has like five project cars.

632
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,919
Well, yeah, but this one at least seems

633
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,440
like it drives. Man, I wish I had a five

634
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
project. He likes to hop in the Suburban

635
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,159
and drive around southern Wisconsin

636
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,600
looking for other projects, cars or

637
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,840
women. Yeah. And then in my daily

638
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,440
driver, my frontier, I cosplay as like I

639
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,679
go on vacation every week out to the

640
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
bush. And I don't I just go to work.

641
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,240
Thank you, sick. Something out there. I

642
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,760
There's something to our right.

643
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,760
FB40005.

644
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Really awkward to try and use that.

645
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,840
There's two of them. Hey, Jim. There's a

646
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,080
second one with him. I know. I was Why

647
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,080
did I follow you? I was about to call it

648
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
out.
