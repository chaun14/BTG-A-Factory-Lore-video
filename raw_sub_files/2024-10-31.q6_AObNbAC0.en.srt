credit for softening him up for that he

102
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,799
did I watched him as I exploded those

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,360

how does no

108
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,639

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,160
the Halloween candy from that yeah he

110
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,759
does and I deserve a portion a smaller

111
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,360
portion of the Halloween candy for

112
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,400
verifying now I feel like I'm getting no

113
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,840
portions of candy here you're just

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,759
getting a substantially smaller portion

115
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,759
of candy this is why I don't like

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,680
communism but it's our

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,600
candy oh yeah start using that Wei word

118
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,919
like we're part of the team

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,440
see how that works

120
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,039
out terms it's your favorite map yeah

121
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
it's great potentially the last time you

122
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,560
see it before the

123
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,320
rework oh and even better aactor is

124
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,560
coming aren't you excited more a factory

125
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,680
it's going to be shiny shiny you know we

126
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,960
should do with the a factory since it's

127
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,840
empty right now and the points move down

128
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
to the middle what we can open a haunted

129
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,319
house with

130
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,759
kv2 first thing we should do at the

131
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,639
haunted house is put a kv2 with a

132
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,639
chainsaw

133
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
why because that's pretty scary it

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,560
doesn't have

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,360
hands just uh tie it to the end the

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,280
barrel yeah faic it's also very

137
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,600
important to take the uh chain off the

138
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,680
chainsaw huh

139
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,560

another M3 Le on that ping the best part

375
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,720
about the K2 is once you shoot somebody

376
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,560
you then get to stare at the next Target

377
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,120
hoping they don't realize you're there

378
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,720
yeah as they're frantically trying to

379
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,720
put a giant two-piece shell into your

380
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,079
breach

381
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,519
yeah you get to play dead I could go

382
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,639
make a snack in real life and come back

383
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,639
and then shoot this no I hit the

384
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:17,600
DI I believe you oh please don't bully

385
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:20,839
him he's just a simple guy he's gone the

386
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,839
flag pans are one no no somebody else

387
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,440
zaring oh oh

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:30,319
okay because an SE 152 just obliterated

389
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,319
a he killed the m43 in front of me I

390
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:36,399
believe it's a locust on Bravo you want

391
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:39,480
to do this I've murdered many of locust

392
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,800
today yeah literally just like 10

393
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,800
minutes

394
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,959
ago I mean technically the Locust is

395
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
below you it's quite a short tank and

396
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,480
you're quite a tall

397
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,480
tank yeah you do sort of loom over

398
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,720
everything D first start is going to be

399
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,639
left of that building at 40 left

400
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,120
side

401
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:04,000
yeah um never mind I was able to hit him

402
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,760
thankfully it was a bit of a tricky shot

403
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,959
so I wasn't sure I was going to go

404
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,720
through you got him yeah dangerous thing

405
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,480
as well the

406
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,559
105 I think we beat him in the size

407
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,919
Department I mean not for is size

408
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,520
everything in this case though when it

409
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,959
comes to derp guns yes size is

410
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,400
everything yeah but I don't know more

411
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,760
boom is better yeah yeah yeah that is

412
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,799
true the bigger the Boom the

413
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:39,480
better I think velocity comes into play

414
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:42,160
as well the fun word we uses assault gun

415
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,880

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,960
a all I can do is spectate my giant tall

474
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,480
turret which is why the Germans like

475
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,799
them for observation like to put theas

476
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,080

radio I feel like there

481
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,600
are more suitable platforms for doing

482
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,400
that with like you could just build a

483
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,760
tower on top of your tank put your

484
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,760
commander on a ladder yeah but why would

485
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,760
they need to

486
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,320
ladder why build the own when it can

487
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,320
