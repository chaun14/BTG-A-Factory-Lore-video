1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,240
honestly the con St there's a mouse to

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,719
your mouse is

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,080
down I'm really surprised that shot took

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,440
from the weird angle I put it over you

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,440
into

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,880
him I just saw nothing but fire at my

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,519
face all right well that was that was

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,880
interesting to come around the corner

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,279
too I thought it was an EBR for a half

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,320
second and then realized no that's way

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,879
too big and then all of a sudden you and

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,160
it has a really cool like Grill on its

13
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,559
roof I didn't get to see that but yeah

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,200
it does back corner that back corner I

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,079
see a lot of marks over there

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,520
too ow a turret just flopped onto me I

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,120
think that was

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,840
mine do you want to go right I do want

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
to go right let's good let's do that

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,480
especially after having Zoot head hit me

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,600
he was just giving you a heads up well

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,480
there's two right there I'm going to

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,680
take the left

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,879
one I just got the track on the other

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,840
one okay what was the thing you saw

26
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,159
otherwise machine gun it yeah I machine

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
gun it it was a

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,159
t114 I'm going to watch behind us Mark

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,360
right there

30
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,640
pushing I can take him in a second I'm

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,320
waiting to reload there one there's one

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,320
in Smoke by the way no that's bad

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,360
[Music]

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,799
bombs imagine that the year is 1989

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,640
you're a young Russian man and you just

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
work very hard to graduate from Soviet

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,520
tank

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
school and you think you might go to a

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,040
fancy t72 unit but instead they gave you

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,880
the t10m the dinosaur of the Soviet tank

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,680
force what is your reaction you know at

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,520
least I'm not likely to get sent to the

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,079
front lines anytime soon it's crazy that

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,680
these things were in reserve until like

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,399
what 1995

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
1996 yeah it was the early ' 90s

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
basically up to the end of the Soviet

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,040
Union that's absolutely

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,000
crazy because these things are

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,439
essentially what the last is variant

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,960
that was created in effect yes I mean

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,680
for its period it was incredibly

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,399
Advanced it was about as far as you

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,879
could realistically take the heavy

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,800
breakthrough

56
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,520
concept I mean it's really not a bad

57
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,360
second lane

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,519
think no not not for its intended role

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,040
it's just that the MBT concept just

60
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,440
supersedes it yeah the Abrams and the

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
leopard have something to say about that

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Leopard 2 in

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,599
particular

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,120
yes I mean would you want to be driving

65
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,879
t1m against those things the Leever to

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,319
no I'm I'm good I'm you know we're

67
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,599
talking about a retirement date in the

68
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,159
'90s that that would be the kind of

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,840
thing you'd be up against hi stms I'm

70
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
following I guess you now cuz I don't

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,319
know where where the enemy is so you're

72
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,959
telling me that it's been leaked that

73
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,200
this map is up for a revamp they were

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,239
upset that not enough people were going

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,840
to the Sea

76
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,840
Depot um well nobody likes the sea Depot

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,840
well you know that now now we have too

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,720
many

79
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,879
se's everybody's going to the a factory

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,760
and it's not got enough output and we've

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,760
got we've got 300,000 tons of unused C's

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,239
so they're closing down the a factory

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,360
because it's too profitable and too

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
popular to focus on a product that

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,400
nobody wants correct because they have a

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,400
surplus on it I mean look at see right

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,120
now like there's one of our friendlies

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,480
down there and he's leaving it this

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,120
sounds like a Disney executive decision

90
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,280
you got to get I I would I would CR up

91
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,159
as many A's as you can before it's too

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,400
light so I can make a a sorry that was

93
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,640

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,640

117
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,520

133
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,600

something you're an is7 you are much

164
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:42,720
fancier I that necessarily mean it's

165
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,759
fancier I don't know it's pretty fancy

I'm half reloaded I think there's

248
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,320
more the nerve-racking thing about the

249
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,440
T10 is your loader is frantically trying

250
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,959
to put another shell in knowing that

251
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,839
death is ENT because a heat shell or uh

252
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,600
missile are inbound any second so STM

253
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,640
the more reason she gets upset is

254
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
because I buy them right before

255
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,760
Christmas or my birthday and then she

256
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,600
doesn't know what to give me are we

257
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,160

Christmas presents they

00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,560
do especially for people who have stuff

263
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,040
it's always fun to mention magic cards

264
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,160
or models when she's nearby because he

265
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,079

Sterling did not win his

417
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,039
fight

418
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,199
gravity I'm also going to uh admit

419
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,679
something I scouted that t32 before you

420
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,039
killed it because I I wanted the credit

421
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,600
for scouting

422
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,600
it there's no shame in there not because

423
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,760
there's any reason for Intel or helping

424
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,240
the team our friend is still there uh

425
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,880

427
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
BB

428
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,520
gun it might have been did a child throw

429
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,559
a rock at you wouldn't surprise me did a

430
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
bird fly over and crap on your tank what

431
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,280
what doesn't pin a

432
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,039
bt76 whatever a shot fall

433
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,120

tall

435
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:57,280
wave a strong dust of wind I'm afraid to

436
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,000
pushed him now I hear it to my right

437
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,679
it's in the building yep

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
I'll try and help you if I can it's an

439
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,480
M48 I shot

440
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,280
over I wanted to make sure it was dead

441
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,600
so I shot it twice it ricocheted off me

442
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,799
twice oh how your PT managed to Ricochet

443
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,280
two things Russian

444
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,679

the splash guard saved him oh

449
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,640
bombs NOP

450
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,120
by you know it's a shame that there's

451
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,520
not two vehicles roaming around with

452
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,400
anti-aircraft barrels that could have

453
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,760
stopped that oh there's three Sterlings

454
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,840
back in spawn I was repairing a truck

455
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,799

tank behind

464
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,720
this somebody wants to try and flank it

465
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,919
that might be the best idea flank it why

466
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,360
flank when we can just drive directly in

467
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,000
front of it well there's also things to

468
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,720
the right I haven't told you about

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,640

this I think just be aware of it i s I

487
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,679

anything two or three I don't know how

489
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,640
many that was kind of a blur what just

490
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,480
happened the whole action is just sort

491
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,760
of you know 3 seconds of chaos the other

492
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,400
one Charlie's

is a Hut of bodies over here yeah you

496
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,240

covers themselves in ant horses oh what

498
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,880
