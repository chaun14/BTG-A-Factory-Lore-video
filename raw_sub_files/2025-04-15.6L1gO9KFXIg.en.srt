1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
You know, always cheers us up on a bad

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,279
night warn gym. What's that? The A

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,960
factory. But unfortunately, this is the

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,639
lame battle version of abandoned

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,519
factory. So, A is over there on their

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,599
side. Welcome to the second location of

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,760
the Aactory.

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,119
My name is Margaret. I will be giving

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,680
you a tour of the Aacto's remote

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,240
location, street vendor. What if I want

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,560
to go to the original AAC location? A

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,920
Factory is closed. You're not allowed.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
What if I'm one of those YouTubers that

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,040
breaks into places and We will call the

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,399
police and get your channel demonetized.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,239
You can't catch me. Oh, yes, I can. I

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
have a drone.

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,200
We have drones, too.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Drone on drone fighting. You You were

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,559
trained on drone combat.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,280
The year 2025 has been very weird in

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,640
advancing for the A factory. Okay. I

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,160
want to let you know as you're fighting

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
for your life, we also have a letter A

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,079
cryptocurrency on Coinbase if you would

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,280
like to invest in the cryptocurrency

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,799
called the letter A.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,200
My favorite part is it sounds like he's

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,560
just holding his chest.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,280
Oh no. T2061 in the gap machine guning

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
you currently. I think you see him. I'm

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,880
sorry the information came too late to

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
help. I took his gunner. I hate how I

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
was useless the entire time and I just

35
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,240
watched you both die.

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,159
I'm more concerned about the

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,200
Ghostbusters secretary voice you were

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,640
trying to do there. That just sounded

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,640
like pain. Ghostbusters.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
What was her name? That drives me nuts

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,479
now. I don't know, but she was cute.

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,799
What?

43
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,479
What? What? I'm just saying.

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,000
Ghostbusters.

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,399
Damn. Please tell us your first

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,840
childhood crush was the Ghostbusters

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:56,640
secretary. One of them. Is he like 80?

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,200
No, no, she's not.

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,759
She just dresses very

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,119
conservative and has kind of a

51
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,280
um what was her demeanor would you call

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,600
it?

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Sweet and bratty in New York. Sweet and

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
bratty.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
Yeah. Uh you know what? You know what? I

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,520
looked up a picture. You know what did

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
it for me? The glasses. The glasses

58
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
holder.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,680
The necklace loop thingy. That's what

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,480
did it. Bunch of targets over here on

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
this wall. Okay,

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,959
I hear them migrating behind us. Don't

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
stick. It's a bad idea. Okay, good luck.

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
Just thing to your right, though.

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
There's one to the left. Yeah, but I was

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,560
more to the right. Sorry, I didn't think

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,760
you're going to go just do that. Hey, so

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,959
B, I'm very concerned. T26es. Oh, I'm

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,360
watching one of them.

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
I don't like T26s and I'm I lost a

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,400
wheel. Help me. I'm trying to hunt one.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm still movable. I'm still mobile. I'm

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,879
still mobile. I'm still movable. Was I

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
gonna say get mobile? Movable. Hey, Jim.

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,480
It's looking at me through the wall of

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,879
his barrel. Okay. I'm I'm I'm coming

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,159
into the uh Oh, god. Stay away from my

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,640
friend. Transmission radiator.

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,280
Get him. Rub him. I need to put a wheel

80
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,760
back on. I'm repairing. I am also

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,680
repairing. Sick is all you right now.

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,720
You're doing a great job out there.

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,480
It's all me in an R3. This one's barrel.

84
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,920
It really needs to go. Why'd you play me

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,440
out? Engine radiator again. Engine

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
radiator again. Still fixing breach. I'm

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
sorry. Two barrels here. I just Okay,

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,720
there's two of them. I'm not even going

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,920
to try to fix this wheel. It's not worth

90
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
it. I have to I'm dropping already

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,720
myself. Jim, you're not going to be able

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
to shoot with three wheels.

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,400
How do you think I got the engine

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,480
radiator on one? Target scout again. Try

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,480
to push through. I'm going to poop

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,280
this. Go, go, go, go. Okay, moving,

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,200
moving, moving. You got shot again. He's

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,440
trying to

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,360
leave. I did nothing. He's got a machine

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,280
gun. He's very upset, Jim. Oh, I'm ready

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
for battle. So sad. I'm ready for

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,760
battle. Help me. I just dropped already

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
here. What am I doing? No, you back up.

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,200
Stop. Just stop. I'll repair you. Just

105
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,760
stop. I'll repair you. Okay. Okay. Okay.

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
We're supposed to look like

107
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,480
professionals. Act like we know what

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
we're doing. I did what I could for you.

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,239
Okay. I appreciate cleaning up the

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,880
entire time. I'm glad that T-34 is over

111
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,919
there doing I can I can walk again. Uh

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,560
gym airplane. Uh hey guys. No, they're

113
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,800
bombing the A factory. Oh no, they are

114
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,759
they are lighting the A factory up in

115
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
bombs. A factory is responsible for any

116
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,639
injury.

117
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,120
This is going terrible.

118
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
Bombs. The roof just fell in. Something

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,080
just tried to shoot at me and missed.

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,919
Did you see that guy just die in front

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,360
of us?

122
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,800
I did that 4 A285.

123
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
I think this is why they moved the A

124
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,320
factory like the actual like a wife was

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,240
miserable enough for him. Uh I guess

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,160
I'll go first. I raised my hand. No, no,

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
no, no. I No, hang on. I got shot. I'll

128
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,280
go first.

129
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,360
Thank you for concluding your tour at

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,639
the original site of the AAC.

131
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,759
Unfortunately, you've been trespassing.

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,560
I'm surprised we haven't seen anything

133
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,759
yet.

134
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
You know what? That's I shouldn't say

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
things like that. I knew it. Can you

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
please take them? Yes. Yes. Yes. Hang

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,000
on. I I need to get the barrel. Barrel.

138
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,479
Come on. Barrel, please. Oh, I'm sorry.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm an

140
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,720
amateur. Hey, stick, can you take him?

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,479
Stick. Stick. Um, just right past him. I

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,479
can try. I'm trying to get on his side.

143
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
I was trying to let the one coilless

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,720
rifle get the kill, but I whiffed that

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,360
so hard. I'm so sorry.

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
I kind of noticed.

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,400
I just froze up. There's a P8. Never

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,840
mind. There was a P8. Oh, thank God. No,

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,800
it was on our team. Oh, never mind. I'm

150
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,960
sorry. Rip that guy.

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Thank you, sir. Let's go repair him.

152
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,080
repair this guy. I don't know if

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,479
grouping up is a great idea right now.

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,919
No, no, no. We're fine. Rats together

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,800
strong. See, look at that. So, uh, you

157
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,440
want me to go, uh, stick a wheel on a

158
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
contact front. Oh, that's really bad. I

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,280
missed a shot.

160
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
Hey, Jim, you are the one proposed

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,759
rifle. I'm just going to keep saying

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,800
that. I know. A right there. I'm

163
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,560
reloading 19. You're unfortunately Jim's

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,840
cost me my life. They're both dead.

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,759
Oh, he's just looking at me, too, like

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm a snack. I am so sorry.

167
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,440
I think this is a learning moment mainly

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,319
for me. There's tanks moving down the

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,720
valley. Mark right there. Yeah, I think

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,880
I saw one of the Koopas going from the

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,240
left to the right. That's 800 m. If I

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,160
see another one pushed right there, I'm

173
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
going to take a shot.

174
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm going to keep watching low over

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,400
here. Contact close to us. I hear an

176
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,759
engine approaching very quickly.

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,800
It belongs to an American T series

178
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:04,400
heavy. Possibly T29. High or low? Right

179
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,599
beside me. Oh, hard left. I guess I

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,759
should have set that first. That would

181
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
have been helpful information. I kind of

182
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,440
want to poke out, but also I remind

183
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,479
myself what I'm in. He just fired. He's

184
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,759
got 50 kills, but I'm going to push him.

185
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,759
I got your backup. Driver loader. Hey,

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,680
looking a bad idea.

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,720
It worked out though. Good teamwork. I

188
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
was worried about detonating myself.

189
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,400
Also, one's still back here. Yep. Okay,

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,599
pushing up. I'm looking for it. Can

191
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,199
breach. He doesn't have a large machine

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,680
gun, so he can No, commander.

193
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,639
He's down. Nice work, guys. Nice work.

194
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,160
Good push.

195
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,319
Now, I think it's time to scattle before

196
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
payback comes. Yeah, I was going to say

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
like they're probably really mad that

198
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,160
couple of rats. You want to go get C?

199
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,400
Triple rat attack. Yeah, triple rat

200
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,639
attack.

201
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Here we are, actually. I mean, wheeled

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,120
vehicles like this, I I often call them

203
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,919
rats. R3's all We hit them with that

204
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,960
ratat.

205
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,080
About the rati, but I'm going to dive

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,319
off this cliff. That's what I'm going to

207
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
do. Oh, Jim, I have a mission. I'm

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,759
sorry, Jim. I'm sorry. Help. Help me.

209
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Help me. I'm sorry. I have a mission to

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,960
complete. Okay. I My people need me.

211
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,240
I just fired from I'm so sorry. I can't

212
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,479
stop laughing. I was dropped into a

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,400
hostage. I'm commercial boss down here.

214
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,400
I can't stop laughing. I'm sorry. Oh

215
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
god. The hill. On the hill. It's up

216
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,360
there laughing at us. I'm looking at the

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,479
hill. I'm looking. We're good.

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
Oh my god. Wait. Where was the one that

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,599
got Jim? I'm not going back to find out.

220
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,279
Being far away.

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,599
No, he's at our level. Oh, he's down

222
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,560
there.

223
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,360
Sorry. Brain's running at max

224
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,360
computations right now.

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm worried about also low right,

226
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,920
but see that mark

227
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,240
stick. That's probably Yeah, I see the

228
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,880
mark. Yep, that is. I think that is. All

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,880
right, let's push carefully.

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,120
All right. I don't like that shell just

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,320
phased through me. Well, I mean, that's

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,440
a teammate. B plate. We're good. Never

233
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,720
mind. All right. If Yeah, you push that

234
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
way. I'll push closer left.

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,760
He's in here somewhere. See that

236
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,959
scumark? He's hiding behind a rock right

237
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,600
there. I can see top of him. That's Jim.

238
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,600
He got bullied by antos.

239
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Yes. Uh there was someone who wanted to

240
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,279
speak with me at the se point while I

241
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,760
was going to be uh watching your guys'

242
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,640
back. Good work, sick.

243
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
Yep. On the way to you. I'm repaired.

244
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm going to watch up at Charlie for a

245
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,680
second.

246
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,160
Yeah, there's one firing again up in the

247
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,200
rocks

248
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,320
here. I'm going to see if I can sneak a

249
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,959
shot in. Saw the scout mark.

250
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,640
M18 did not see

251
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,560
him. That's from my rear. Uh, he's

252
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,320
watching right now to your hard left.

253
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
Are you breaking up with me? No, I just

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
feel like you can find better teammates

255
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
because I feel like your tubs are my

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,200
fault. I'm sorry. That one I had nothing

257
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,320
to do with.

258
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay. I don't know that T3485

259
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,920
say we're having a moment here and I

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
just Are you breaking up with me? 85

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
millimeter shell hits you in the face.

262
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,240
God, what a what a day, huh? That

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,560
timing. What a day.

264
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,839
Oh, I see

265
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,480
him. There we go. Vengeance was served.

266
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
Thank you. I'm just got a tank up.

267
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,680
There's one pushing on our side. That's

268
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,079
M18.

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
Holy moly. I was looking for Yeah,

270
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,079
that's him. That was the M18 I was

271
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,040
looking for.

272
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,800
Wow, his turret went

273
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,160
like a whole grid square away. I like

274
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
how I'm hiding behind this body, using

275
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,320
it for concealment a little bit, backing

276
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,839
up, and then stick just parks right on

277
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,240
the edge of the cliff, silhouetting

278
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,760
himself like, "Hi, I'm here. Witness my

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
AA greatness." There's a plane flying

280
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,800
right at us. Plane. Oh, that's a bad

281
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,800
time to run alone.

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,680
Don't worry, I helped. I'm so concerned

283
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,839
for our futures. It sounds like there's

284
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,399
an entire motorpool of tanks on the

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,920
other side of this wall.

286
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
It really does. I'm kind of afraid. Is

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,279
someone going to Kool-Aid man through

288
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,680
this? Yeah, one just broke the wall.

289
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,320
It's pushing

290
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,480
fast. You see him right there? Yep. He

291
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,200
sees me. He's going to push me a second.

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,360
He just shot the two.

293
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, that's a left.

294
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,880
I'm

295
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,880
going driver, machine gunner. The other

296
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,240
one's got a lot of 50 cals on

297
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,800
them. Also, there's a Tiger just running

298
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,720
free. That's a T34.

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Gunner, machine gunner,

300
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,320
Tiger. Okay, this is a I'm sorry, big

301
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,360
boy. You have to go

302
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,360
first. Or they can all rush in here.

303
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,800
Aren't those tanks more terrifying when

304
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
you're that small and they're that big?

305
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
I was just thinking they're generally

306
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
terrifying when they all push together.

307
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,839
I just want to find somewhere where we

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,279
can

309
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,279
um capture point and have a nice

310
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,120
life. I don't think that's in the cards

311
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,079
though. No. Why did I go this way? Why

312
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
did this go this way? He can't look at

313
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,480
me. He can't look at me. Did you go the

314
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
same way? No. No. I I went I I'm off to

315
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,200
your right. Stick. Be careful. There's

316
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,000
big things. Get to your front through

317
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
that wall. Yep. I'm hiding behind the

318
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,320
alo. Contact left up on the hill. That

319
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,320
was a bad mark.

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
I'm surprised I was able to make it

321
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
through this. Damn, we need to push

322
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,279
through that. That shell went through a

323
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,519
stick and almost took me out, too. Okay,

324
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
I go through the tunnel. Yes, please go

325
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,920
through the tunnel. Go through the

326
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
tunnel. Go through the tunnel. I hate it

327
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,079
here. Oh, god. You're close left. There

328
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
might be something.

329
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,240
Close left. Is it clear?

330
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,279
for now. Yes. There's a We got tigers.

331
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
You have a plan or you just panic to

332
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,160
keep driving off cuz I'm following you.

333
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm going to I'm going to go to B. Let's

334
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,079
go to B. We just gave up on A. Yeah, A.

335
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
A's a silly. Well, you can't be. I'm

336
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,279
going to push past and see if there's

337
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
anything over here. Here. Hide behind

338
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,880
the flammable tank with me. I found

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,399
something. Tell me about yourself. Oh,

340
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,639
what' you find? There's a rare tiger. A

341
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,880
rare tiger.

342
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,880
Your

343
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:33,360
favorite. He's processing. Oh, he looked

344
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,200
in the kill feed. Oh. Oh, yeah. The one

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,320
with the hybrid noise to let you know

346
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,320
that it's coming when it's slow.

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
What? Yeah. Have you noticed how all the

348
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
teammates around us are kind of just

349
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,240
vanishing?

350
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,399
Yeah. Is there something scary over

351
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,600
here? Yeah, there is.

352
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,959
Where? Wait, that's a in front of me.

353
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,160
There's a tiger right here. No, I'm

354
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,720
sorry. That's something big. There's a

355
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
big thing over there.

356
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,839
Um. Oh boy. I'm scared. I have to wait

357
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,120
for him to break the wall. I didn't do

358
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,480
anything. Oh. Oh my god.

359
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,240
Protect yourself. I'm I'm Got my gunner.

360
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,720
I only got his commander. Pull his tail.

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,160
No, I don't think that works on a tank.

362
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
It's a tiger. I'll just shoot him and

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,959
blow him up with a heat shell. Okay,

364
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,959
thank you. It's time to run. We got to

365
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
go. Oh, hello. Oh, you didn't finish

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,240
capping. I'm trying to help. No, cuz you

367
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,040
were in trouble. Do you want me to go

368
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
finish?

369
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,560
Wait. No. Jip. No. No. Jip. Jip. No.

370
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
There's a Churchill. I don't know what

371
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,199
he's trying to say other than I heard a

372
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Churchill. Goodbye. Goodbye. I'm

373
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,480
leaving. Be a lost cause. Goodbye.

374
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,040
Where's the Church Hill? Uh, it's

375
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,040
apparently it's over there.

376
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Thank you for this information as I'm

377
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,800
now pushing my face into danger.

378
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,120
Somewhere over there. It's over there.

379
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,440
Yeah, it's somewhere over there.

380
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,279
It's there. Go on your track. You can

381
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,480
swarm it. See if you can break his

382
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
barrel.

383
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,959
Okay, trying. Okay, let's see if I can

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,440
take the rest of

385
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,399
them. Drivers out cuz we're worried

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,040
about him, you know, trying to run away.

387
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,360
There's a Panzer 470. Where's the Panzer

388
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,639
470, Jim? Other side of a building from

389
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,680
you. I don't know. It's just concrete

390
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,680
all over. Man, about that Tiger.

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,639
And we're going to go this direction

392
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,120
now. I want to

393
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:28,399
go. What a catastrophe this match is.

394
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,720
Really like truly a catastrophe.

395
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,160
I just want to go home. Stick is broken.

396
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,040
I can't even get any information out of

397
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,959
him at this point.

398
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,160
A fun experience for the whole family. I

399
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:44,079
would watch to your front right.

400
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,279
I see it behind the barrels. Yeah. Copy.

401
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,680
Driver gunner. You got time if you want

402
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,839
to flank it and kill the twin bill. You

403
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,600
want me to leave it for you or take it?

404
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,600
If you got it, take it.

405
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,160
I was reloading.

406
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:05,199
That's okay. How about that airplane?

407
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,680
Oh, hey, there's a PL. Yep. Don't worry.

408
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,240
I think I'm going to work with M18. He

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,959
seems trustworthy.

410
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,839
He's leaving us for tank destroyers.

411
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,920
That makes sense. You heard, Mike?

412
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
Oh, can you do anything to it? Let's

413
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah, you're good. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

414
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,399
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

415
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

416
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,519
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

417
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
Nice work. Front

418
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,839
danger. Oh, I got the track. No, I want

419
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,959
to back up. I would like to back up.

420
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,959
Back up. Yes, I'm back. Back up.

421
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,040
I don't want him to turn.

422
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
So, that was a hit not to drive forward.

423
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,440
Okay. Do you want to turn around, go

424
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
back home? Maybe. I think we should go

425
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,440
across the river and flank whatever is

426
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
taking everybody from the other side. I

427
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
was going to say we go home. I got pizza

428
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,639
rolls in the freezer. I can share them

429
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,480
with you. You just want to leave. That's

430
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
all you want to do. Yes, I do. I want to

431
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,040
go home. There's no place like We can

432
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,440
make the run across this bridge, Jim,

433
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,759
and then make the run across the other

434
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,839
bridge, flank those guys, and become

435
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,440
glorious war heroes. Okay, I believe

436
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,920
you. If it goes to hell, it's your

437
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,319
fault. Oh, let's focus on Jim. Save

438
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,319
yourself. I have no front wheels.

439
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:13,280
No. Oh, just save yourself. Oh, no. I

440
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,199
ain't got no legs.

441
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,679
Uh, they also took the thing that makes

442
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,919
the other wheels drive. It's right

443
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,120
there.

444
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,640
Thank you. It's dead. Okay, it's dead.

445
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
Oh, you look ridiculous. Get yourself

446
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,559
together. I'm sorry. There's a lot of

447
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,039
trauma happening here. You look so

448
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,679
silly. Okay. Got wheels. There's a No.

449
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,240
No. Not again. Not again.

450
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,240
I didn't know which way to cover. I

451
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,520
could have had pizza rolls and been

452
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,280
comfy. And you drag me out here. You

453
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,880
lose your wheels. I lose my head. I

454
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,480
mean, the pizza roll is very convenient.

455
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
and I can put it in a bowl and just kind

456
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
of munch on it like a glutton. Whereas

457
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,760
like a pizza big, I'll have to put it on

458
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,360
a platter. Hey, just a status update.

459
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,679
We're being pushed pretty hard by tanks

460
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,640
on all

461
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,840
fronts. Marking one right there. You got

462
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,360
a close rifle or something? Sorry.

463
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,360
Another one marked over there loader.

464
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,000
Does anybody have any weaponry that is

465
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,720
attached to like a heat shell or not?

466
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,160
Not really. Unfortunately, the best you

467
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,280
get is air.

468
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,559
Yes. You got anything like light

469
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,559
skinned? Like maybe like a a truck or a

470
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,240
You got a plane maybe? Yeah, like a

471
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,760
tractor with some corrugated steel

472
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
plate.

473
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,280
Uh the sink just fired me down the

474
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
river.

475
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Also, very slow plane coming in. It

476
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
looks like he's going towards the

477
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,039
building.

478
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,600
No, beer covered. I two or 10 over the

479
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,000
river.

480
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Hey, I got him.

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Like I was shooting sporting clays. Is

482
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,080
that a locust?

483
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,240
Wait, what? I don't take any solless in

484
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,640
that. But

485
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,400
no forgiveness. Forgiveness ended. No.

486
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh, the P8 that dropped the bomb on me

487
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,000
is named slap lettuce.

488
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,240
You think he slaps his lettuce?

489
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,440
Oh, I thought his lettuce slapped. Why

490
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,960
do you think he does the cabbage? Hey,

491
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,960
so these three bombs I was going to drop

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,160
on their team just got reallocated to my

493
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,880
squadmates. I see a whole herd of them

494
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,840
over on

495
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,520
Bravo. That looks like an ontos,

496
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,360
which I could use cannons, but a bomb

497
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,080
feels way more necessary right now.

498
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,200
That's a bit intense. No, no, no. Hetos

499
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,799
deserves it. It's been that kind of

500
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,360
match. It has something I try next to

501
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,080
you. Stick.

502
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Do you see what I'm in? You're the only

503
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,720
one that can stop it. Or I could stop

504
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,880
it. I could stop and I could have just

505
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
Never mind.

506
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
We could have came up with a better

507
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,799
plan. You said I was the only one who

508
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,559
could stop it. I mean, on the ground.

509
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,880
I'm I'm in the air and I technically did

510
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,240
stop him,

511
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,440
but next time I'll be sure to say you're

512
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
the only one on the ground. Also,

513
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
something you right here, Jim. Yes. It's

514
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,760
a bat bomb. I'm trying to help you.

515
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,880
You got him. I got tracks in a

516
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,280
barrel. Also, something hit me pretty

517
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,960
hard. I got

518
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,039
him. Thank you for your assist. No

519
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,360
problem. The thing that got me is on my

520
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,360
left now.

521
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,200
Flying towards you. Unfortunately,

522
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,960
trying to locate you. Where's my friend?

523
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,799
Where's my friend? I'm going down. He's

524
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:37,480
over the city. Oh

525
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:37,480
no. B1's down. Awesome.

526
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,240
I like how gave me soft landing for

527
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,320
that. That didn't feel soft

528
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,720
or really landing. Was it the kind where

529
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
like your teeth fall out? I love those.

530
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,600
I was expecting to find a big heavy tank

531
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,240
over here, but I found this little

532
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,840
guy. And I just missed that somehow.

533
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
Oh, okay. All right. Good news. We have

534
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
a machine gun on our obble, and I'm

535
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,320
happy to use it. That was slightly

536
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,039
embarrassing. I'm happy you're happy.

537
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,520
That was actually kind of scary. Front.

538
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,200
I see it. I did nothing. That was an

539
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,880
awkward time to jump over the concrete

540
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,760
barrier. Hey Jim, there's IS-6 that

541
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,600
wants to meet you. There's an M103 that

542
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,200
actually is taking me out. Why did we

543
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,000
just run through the two biggest tanks

544
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,280
we could possibly find? Because we are

545
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,080
in little rat tanks and uh yeah, that's

546
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,559
how it goes.

547
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,440
Okay. He's like saving me from the M103.

548
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,200
This is awkward.

549
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
Did he want cuddles? Was he saving me

550
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
for later? I don't know what just

551
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,600
happened to me. Was I just offered up as

552
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,280
payment 103 over here?

553
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,960
Engine track. You want to try and finish

554
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,280
him? Driver loader. Driver loader. All I

555
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,880
can get. Unfortunately, he took my

556
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,159
gunner. It still had it shell for me.

557
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,440
I don't know if I'm going to be able to

558
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,520
do very much, but uh go for his barrel

559
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,080
if he

560
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:04,240
can or keep him distracted.

561
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,039
I was hoping for more of that hit.

562
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,280
We're okay. I just keep circling them.

563
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, I'm just just make sure I friend

564
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,039
doesn't push in here as well. Uh, can

565
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,000
you take his tracks? 50 cal's gone.

566
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,400
I'm almost loaded. Hello, Jim. Welcome

567
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
back to the party. Thanks.

568
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
I am here to help. Let's go. Put that

569
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,240
one there. And then this. I like how

570
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,240
there's two Tiger 2 staring at him,

571
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,240
though.

572
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,000
All righty. So, now we got to go find

573
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
the IS-6, right? I don't know if he's

574
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,720
still alive or not. It's been a while

575
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,080
since I've had a sighting on him.

576
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Understandable. We can we can pick we

577
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
can totally pick apart number six,

578
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,320
right? He's still alive.

579
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,720
All right, let's just assemble it.

580
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,720
Oh, you guys know where he's going.

581
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Okay.

582
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,720
Well, I did nothing, but he should be

583
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,520
distracted by me. Okay, I'm I'm putting

584
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
a new belt in. Putting a new belt

585
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,760
in. I'm keeping him kind of over here if

586
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,520
I can. He's still pulling towards me.

587
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,679
Keep driving. Keep driving. All right,

588
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,360
here we go. Uh, there's a plane about

589
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,799
Jim. He's turning faster than I can.

590
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,080
Bo, I'm trying. B, I'm trying. Got the

591
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,919
gunner. We have time. Just take that can

592
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,919
if you can. Trying to We're in a another

593
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,440
fight that's happening like this. Okay.

594
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,039
Can we uh like put some bomb music in

595
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,000
there? His machine guns up. You can take

596
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:34,640
it. The top one.

597
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,799
Okay, it's down. Picked them apart. Oh,

598
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,559
there's a jet.

599
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,559
I six down. Yeah, it's it's quite big.

600
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,159
7 seconds. See, that shell just almost

601
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,760
hit me out there. Yeah, it's actually

602
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,080
really scary. Oh. Oh, hey, there's a

603
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,280
plane.

604
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,280
I don't know why I'm laughing cuz I'm

605
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
next.

606
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I should have been there, man. I should

607
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
have saw it.

608
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:08,960
