>> finish.

184
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
>> Hey, they got my barrel.

185
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,319
>> Is that a Chappie or Walker Bulldog

186
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
left?

187
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,360
>> That is an M18.

188
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,000
>> Of course it is.

189
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,720
>> I'm repairing my barrel. Not fight.

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,639
>> Uh, he is. He's just to the left of the

191
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
uh C34.

192
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
>> They ran off. Landing on me.

193
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,240
>> Oh god. Calm landing on me.

194
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,280
>> Chop from right.

195
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
>> They took my legs.

196
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,919
>> I'm flanking left.

197
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
You good?

198
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,880
>> Down for 20 25 seconds. Down for 25

199
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,240
seconds.

200
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,000
>> Where's that other shooter?

201
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,800
>> Probably right about

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
here.

203
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,759
>> Corner. Corner right there. Got my

204
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
breach.

205
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
>> M18 pushing out right there. Jim,

206
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,120
>> 10 seconds. 10 seconds. Can't do

207
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,840
anything.

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,720
>> Uh, guys, commander before I go.

209
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
>> You might be fine.

210
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
I just assume the same six is going to

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,440
No, he's still pushing.

212
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
>> Pushing up right there, Jim.

213
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319

to get shot. Trying to get a shot.

215
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,720
>> He took most of my crew right there.

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
Marking again.

217
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
>> Looking. Looking. Looking.

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,120
>> Thank you. I'm repairing.

219
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,560
>> Good shot.

220
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,639
>> All right. Advancing.

221
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
>> We need to push Bravo as fast as we can.

222
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,080
>> Yes, we do.

>> Oh, I see.

226
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,240
>> I'm dropping RD and Bravo cuz I can.

227
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,319
>> Oh, okay.

228
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
>> Watch me RD you and I'll be very sad. I

229
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,199
was going to say like first he leaves us

230
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,800

>> I got to get more artillery kills.

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,520

>> Will you do door dash?

239
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,080
>> No.

240
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
>> But say that's not a very reliable

241
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,400
vehicle to do door dash in.

242
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,840
>> Oh yeah. I would Oh man. Can you

243
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,199

would be in this thing?

245
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
>> Cuz they never get there. Yeah, cuz they

246
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,080

I still hear more. There's still more on

253
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,160
the mall.

>> M6 backing up right there.

262
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
>> Backing up. You might have a shot.

263
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,560
>> They'll back up right into you.

264
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,240
>> There's two though on the hill.

265
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,959
>> There's two over there.

266
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
>> Got him.

267
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,440
>> Marked on map right there.

268

>> Oh, yeah. I see I see there's another

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
one. T34. Mission failed. No.

270
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,399
>> No.

271
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,399
>> Actually, that's an IS-1. Correction.

272
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,120
>> Why is there always so much industrial

273
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,000
sabotage at the AAC? The aactory has a

274
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,120
very very interesting history. It's been

275
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,760
both a museum, a historical site for

276
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,959
many assassination attempts of uh world

277
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,760
leaders. It's been bought, it it's done

278
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,040
buyouts, it's been auctioned, it's been

279
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,640
shipped overseas, brought back here, and

280
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
now I don't even know what the A factory

281
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,920
is anymore.

282
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,200
I know that they make all forms of the

283
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,519
letter A, bold and italicized,

284
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
but like I don't know who owns the A

285
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,279
factory anymore.

286
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,839
>> Not the community, Jim. What world

287
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,680
leaders came to the A factory?

288
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
>> Uh M18.

289
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,560
>> Oh, another one bites the dust. Oh,

290
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,600
>> that was assassinated.

291
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,839
>> Uh, Princess Zelda. Pyrole.

292
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,640
>> Princess Zelda. Wait, wait. We're in the

293
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,160
universe of Zelda.

294
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,920
>> Yeah, like Pyro is a real place. You

295
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,040
ever been there?

296
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
No, Jim. I have not.

297
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
>> Yeah, we'll pick up excited now.

298
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
>> He is.

299
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
>> You're telling me that I can go to

300
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
>> looking.

301
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
>> I have no ability to face that way right

302
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
now.

303
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,080
>> Okay, I am you and facing there. He's

304
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,959
shooting at me right there.

305
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,519
>> Don't worry, I can get him.

306
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,279
>> I'm 5 seconds back there.

307
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
>> Oh gosh. Oh, it's a big one. That's a

308
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,640
big one. That one hurts.

309
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,760
>> You got to go. You got to go. You got to

310
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
>> I'm going to use your body for cover.

311
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,720
So, I'm going to do

312
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,320
>> what you can and then uh give me a call

313
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
at the back when you get there. Think

314
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,000
you got a shot?

315
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
>> Nope, not really.

316
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
>> Jim's body is great cover.

317
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
>> I took down 164.

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
>> T34's down.

319
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
>> We should drive.

320
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
>> We need to push forward now cuz we're

321
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
going to lose that factory completely.

322
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
>> It's clear.

323
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,160
>> Watch your front. It's not clear front.

324
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
Contact to your front right through that

325
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
wall.

326
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,560
>> Whoa. That's not good.

327
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,320
>> Any repairs? Cuz I can't repair you.

328
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,360
Jim, is not a bad time to invest in the

329
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,040
AAC?

330
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
>> I You know what? If I were to go on my

331
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
cash app right now, it would say it

332
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,760
would say uh uh hold. Actually,

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> who is shooting you?

334
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,519
>> I don't know. Artillery.

335
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,959
>> I feel like now's a bad time to arrive.

336
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
A bomb just landed on you.

337
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,440
>> Oh my gosh, my stocks.

338
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
>> They're burning.

339
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,519
>> They are. I lost everything in the AAC

340
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,959
stock market.

341
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
>> It's plummeting, Jim.

342
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,279
>> I even used Acoin as well.

343
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,360
>> Uh the the A factory. Yes,

344
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,000
>> there is a tank here somewhere.

345
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
>> I think I hear it.

346
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
But I'm going to be honest. I could be

347
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
hearing friendlies. I could be hearing

348
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,000
>> another bomb.

349
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
>> Brace.

350
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,000
>> Oh, good. He didn't get you.

351
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
I have a radical new idea how to survive

352
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
this round.

353
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
>> What would that be?

354
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,800
>> A disguise.

355
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,000
>> Well, it's a disguise. Oh.

356
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,560
>> Oh, I see.

357
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
>> Why' you say it like that? Cuz

358
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,399
my disguise worked and yours didn't.

359
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,040
>> Okay. Yep. Uh-huh. All right. A likely

360
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
story for a spy.

361
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
>> See, he kind of took a shot at me, then

362
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,079
stopped because he realized, oh, wait,

363
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,519
that's friendly. This round's gone so

364

poorly on breaking out Team Fortress 2

365
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,279
spy tactics.

366
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,639
See, it does work.

367
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:16,320
Back in 1875, the Aactory was founded by

368
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:19,680
Alistister Adams Alexander III.

369
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,959
He was a Norwegian immigrant

370
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,200

371
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,160
a with an umlouse. Sorry, I I don't

372
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720

373
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,639
AAC.

374
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,639
>> Please not again. Anything but this.

375
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,639
Tune in next time for the next exciting

376
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,040
episode of a factory lore. Ah, yes. The

boy band on the foldout stage. All three

378
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,680
of them.

379
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,079
>> Would you stop making me feel bad about

380
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,079
my vehicle choice? Also, where's that

381
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,079
T2?

382
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,839
>> It's uh

383
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,839
>> I hear him, but I can't see him.

384
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,240
>> I just saw him. Where'd he go?

385
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,440
>> I see the ME410. M410's on him.

386
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
That's a yak.

387
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,720
>> No, that's a yak.

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,720
>> Where's the tu?

389
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,760
>> Please don't let me die to him another

390
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,040
time.

391
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,800
>> Is he behind you?

392
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,839
>> Is he Hang on. What's that thing behind

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,480
act 9. Something flew.

398
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,519
>> No. Hall front. Hold front.

399
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,000
>> Pull front.

400
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,120
>> All front up. What is that?

401
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
>> All front up.

402
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,399
>> Those are warning shots to go away. He

>> Yo,

408
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
>> I want to leave.

409
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
>> Please shooting clay birds.

410
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,680
>> Please let me leave.

411
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,959
>> When you're when you're in an AA, shoot

412
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,639
the bomb. Don't run.

413
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079

>> I already accepted defeat this match.

416
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
Even though we have the cap, but we

417
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,880
could win. In my heart, we already lost.

418
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,720
We have to.

419
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
>> Just because your morale is gone doesn't

420
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,959
mean you got to give up on this team.

421
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,560
>> Gem stocks burned. My disguise failed.

422
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,800
>> My stocks haven't burned. They're just

423
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,399
low. If we get the cap, I can get my

424
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
stocks back and then I can retire.

425
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,839
Another

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,000

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,600

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,240
>> That's a

430
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
What's a Bearcat?

431
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,760
Are they like more in sync or are they

435
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,720
like uh um uh 98 degrees? Backstreet

436
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
boys.

437
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,360
>> He's 47 with HVRs incoming.

438
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,920
>> I see something out by the spawn.

439
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,680
>> Please.

441
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,240
>> He's got one more bomb. I can't fire

442
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,240
that way very well.

443
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,880
If he comes back, I'll help. Actually,

444
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,800
he's come back around towards dark self

445
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,920
stick.

446
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,760
Okay. Looking. There you go.

447
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,560
>> I shouldn't have told you that. I guess

448
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,839
>> I look away for two seconds.

449
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,480
>> M18s really like you.

450
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,880
P47's down.

451
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,760
I like the way his wing fell off. Made

452
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,760
me happy. In the '9s, there was a

453
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
politician by the name of Bob Dole. He

454
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,680
was very famous for making a speech

455
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,639
called the giant sucking sound of

456
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,240
American industry. The aactory was part

457
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,079
of that giant sucking sound. And the

458
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,800
Aactory has not been the same since,

459
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
especially since they went public.

460
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000
>> Are you going to tie Al Gore to the AAC

461
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
next?

462
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,800
>> No. No, he has nothing to do with this.

463
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,320
He's actually he works at the G factory.

464
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,760
>> Why the G factory?

465
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,720
>> Gore.

466
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,519
>> Oh, I see.

467
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,680
>> Is that where they made the internet?

468
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,600
No, the the internet actually was uh

469
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
made at the tube factory because there's

470
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,480
a very famous news uh interview where

471
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,600
the internet is a series of tubes from

472
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
like 1992.

473
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,399
>> So, you're saying the Gactory claimed it

474
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
made the internet?

475
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,079
>> Well, the G Factory is kind of weird.

476
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
That's one of those like weird like

477
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,079
companies that

478
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160

481
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,639
portfolio in the AAC. I'm actually a uh

>> Contact left ambush.

484

>> Jim, they're coming for your stock

486
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,120

>> Shoot that one. Shoot that one.

488
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
>> Trying to. I don't know where it is. I

490
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,000

>> Now shoot the R3. Murder the rat car.

>> Yes. Shoot my mark down. Rats down. I've

496
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,279

>> No rats. The a

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
Yep, I see it.

501
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,279
>> Hi, Jim. I have trauma.

502
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
>> Hello. Are you You're burning.

503
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,199

504
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,040
>> Oh my gosh.

505
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,560
>> Fire hot.

506
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,959
>> Guys, do you want to know the the real

507
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,480
dark secret of the AAC?

508
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,920
>> Uh bomb landing on you. I'm sorry I

509
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
couldn't catch him.

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,839
>> That's okay.

511
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,600
>> I think that was the CIA trying to keep

512
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,440
you from talking about the AAC anymore.

513
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
>> No, I'll come back. I'll come back. I I

514
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
refuse to be a victim. I will not be

515
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
quiet. I'm going to go on all of the

516
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,520
podcasts that have all the

517
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,720
whistleblowers.

518
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,880
Where does the A factory get its

519
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,400
funding, Jim?

520
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,600
>> You know there's a weapon that's often

521
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,039
referred to as the A bomb.

522
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,039
>> Are you saying they developed the atomic

523
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,280
bomb at A?

524
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,559
>> Yes. All forms of the letter A. Bold,

525
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,559
alticize, and nuclear.

526
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,880
You see, the A factory,

527
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,240
>> the Lauron, this just goes everywhere at

528
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,960
this point. I don't even know how to

529
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,679
connect this. The aactory is one of

530
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,720
those very very sketchy companies that

531
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,440
has fingers in the pies of all the

532
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,360
players of World War II.

533
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
>> No, that's that's different. That's next

534
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,559
episode.

535
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,000
>> Imagine if Amazon was in World War II.

536
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,080
>> We just prime shipped everything to

537
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,600
Europe.

538
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,200
>> Oh my god, that'd be hilarious. Can you

539
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
imagine just like all all of the

540
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,320
electric vans just showing up on

541
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,919
Normandy with a bunch of like packages?

542
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Amazon flux drivers with crates of

543
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
grenades.

544
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640

545
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
ships.

546
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
>> Instead of like the duel at Cologne

547
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,240
where it's the the Persing versus the

548
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,080
Panther, it's just like the Amazon truck

549
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,679
running over a freaking Panther.

550
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,799
>> What is the Amazon brand stuff again?

551
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,080
Like Amazon Choice

552
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,280
>> Prime.

553
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
>> No, they have a name though, right?

554
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,600
There's like a brand like the

555
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,679
>> Amazon Choice.

556
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,400
>> I forget.

557
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,120
I I think it's

558
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
>> I just imagine 30 out 6 Amazon choice.

559
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,679
>> Oh my god. Instead of D-Day, it's it's

560
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,720
Prime Day.

561
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,320
>> Prime Day.

562
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,600
>> All amphibious landing crafts are half

off.

564
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,919
>> Yep.

565
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,160
>> Something's wrong with us. We've been

566
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,520
hurt by industry.

567
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,640
>> We really have.

568
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,240
>> No, I think this isn't War Thunder.

569
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,240
>> Uh plane over the coast coming back in.

570
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,240
>> Where?

571
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
Here's another really dark thing about

572
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
the A factory or

573
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,280
>> main road.

574
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,559
>> Every every letter A on the on the

Allied side in World War II most likely

576
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
came from the A factory, but there are

577
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
conflicting sources that say a lot of

578
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,039
German materials that use the letter A

579
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,080
also had uh a factory serial numbers on

580
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,160
it. It's very it's very corrupt

581
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,440
>> at this point. Just let me drag a banner

582
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,400
behind me so I can do some advertising

583
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
and make some money because

584
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
nobody is shooting at me.

585
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
>> Well, stick boy, we've had a really good

586
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,880
ball game today. We'd like to take a

587
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,000
moment to thank our sponsor, uh, the

ME410B pulling around there by Mr. Bo

589
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,919

sponsor. Thank you very much. I I am the

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,320
>> That's a bad sound.

594
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
>> And someone has a Hail Mary nuke. Let's

595
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,799

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,559
you think on the field? Uh Jim, I am

597
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,240
pleased to announce that it is for the

598
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,280
home team.

599
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
>> Hey, I'm being shot at.

600
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,240
>> Factory is going to be

601

>> I can leave soon. Please, please shoot

more accurately

603
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,280
>> here. I'll turn right towards you.

604
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
>> Well, if I could if I could uh my

605
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,039
greatest mentor is John Madden. Let me

606
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,039
let me just draw some yellow stuff on

607
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,080
here. You're seeing the big the big

608
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,480
>> hostile takeover.

609
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,840
>> This offensive push on a you see you got

610
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
the running back here. You know, he

611
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
thinks he has a hole with the offensive

612
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,080
line. The problem is the guard trips. He

613
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,760
forgets his block and the offensive line

614
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,720
>> that nuke cannot come fast enough.

615
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,200
Please

616
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,160
>> is now in strike everybody down

617
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,080
>> is now in a bad spot. See this is not

618
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,919
good for coordinator is losing his mind.

619
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,679
>> And see what they always say about stick

620
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
boy is the best defense is a good

621
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,280
offense and vice versa. You see, I'm

622
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
going to keep drawing yellow stuff on

623
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,640
the screen to make it seem like I'm

624
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,400
talking about because you have to

625
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
realize that a lot of sports casters,

626
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,320
your dad, if they watch enough football,

627
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,600
they could probably do their job. But

628
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,400
never mind, they don't have the voice.

629
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,400
Anyway,

630
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,960
it seems the blimp is shooting at the

631
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,720
booth. That's very weird. Anyway, and

632
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,000
touchdown.

633
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,280
And that's it. Your uh team has won. I

634
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,720
actually don't remember who dropped the

635
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,720
nuke. The the A town atomics win the

636
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
game.

637
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,080
>> Today's good broadcast is brought to you

638
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,400
by the letter A. No, we don't have crazy

639
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,200
ties to to weird dictators back in World

640
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
War II. We swear.

641
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,360
[Laughter]

642
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,440
>> We're all slowly going insane.

643
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,240
I was holding it until I heard the dog

644
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,240
go off NFL team.

645
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,679
>> You want to rock paper scissors? Who

646
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,559
goes first?

647
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,080
>> Yeah. Uh, all right. One, two, three.

648
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,720
>> We have to like do with the Oh.

649
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,280
>> Oh. Oh. With the barrel. One. Hang on.

650
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,400
We're very slow. One.

651
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,840
>> This isn't working very well, is it? Cuz

652
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
I can't do the up and down motion very

653
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
fast.

654
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,840
>> Yeah. It's like It's like we're playing

655
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,960
rock paper scissors in slow motion. I I

656
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,440
hear that tank to the right of us.

657
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,559
Should we?

658
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,280
>> He's trying to figure out why we haven't

659
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,400
pushed yet. And we're trying to figure

660
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
out how to play rock, paper, scissors

661
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
with a tank. All right.

662
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,960
>> Do you want scissors? I'm going.

663
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,159
>> Okay. All right. Oh god. You got

664
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,559
>> I got paper.

665
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,919
>> That was a rock. Sorry. That was a rock.

666
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,559
>> Okay. He's down. Are you good? Are you

667
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,840
good? What hurt?

668
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
>> Emotionally. No. He's about the bush

669
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,679
right there.

670
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,799
>> Okay. All right. I'm angling. I'm

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,159
angling. I'm angling.

672

>> All right. I'm almost loaded. I'm almost

673
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,600
loaded.

674
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
>> I'll push first.

675
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
>> Okay. Go ahead.

676
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,919
>> Make sure to advance around the corner.

677
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,320
Take him when he kills me.

678
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,559
>> No.

679
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,360

building.

681

>> What are these things? There's one,

682
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,960
>> I think. Oh, type 61. Okay.

683
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
>> Okay. Uh, Jim.

684
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,320
>> Yes.

685
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,919
>> Dangerous ugles.

>> Oh, you won.

687
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
>> There's only two, right?

688

>> Yes. As far as I know.

689
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,120
>> That was so close to me dying.

690
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,200
What horrible thing happened here?

691
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,360
>> I don't know. Oh gosh. What did Hang on.

692
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,120
>> Contact right. M19.

M42, I'm sorry.

695

>> Mitro passed me because I thought he was

701
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,720
AFK. I didn't know he needed help.

>> No, I'm I'm fixing one and then the AFK

>> ASU.

713
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,559
>> Why is he still driving at us? Why is he

714
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,440
killing people?

715
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,799
>> Wait a minute. Uh, I got the commander.

716
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,159
>> He just got bombed.

717
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,919
>> He did.

718
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
>> What was happening?

719
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,280
>> I don't know. But that ASU for some

720
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
reason did not see the menacing of me

turn.

722
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,000
>> Did he want cuddles?

723
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,679
>> I I don't know. But like you have to

724
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,159
understand like we're at the BR where an

725
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,200
ASU57 is like a Chihuahua with the

726
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,280
plague.

727
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
>> If he took me out, everybody else is

728
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,080
looking a different direction. So he

729
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
could have got a multi-kill on Panthers

730
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
and Protype Panthers.

731
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,480
>> Both these VKs are just so transfixed on

732
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,080
what is going on down here. They they

733
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,200
did not realize how much danger they

734
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,400
were in.

735
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,080
>> All right, this one's repaired.

736
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,000
I think our work here is done.

737
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,000
>> I I think so, too.

738
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
We need to work on our rock, paper,

739
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,240
scissors game.

740
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
>> We really do.

741
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,039
>> It's so weird watching him try to slowly

742
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,159
raise his barrel as I'm just staring

743
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,760
down at him.

744
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
>> Tell him you had the higher ground.

745
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,559
>> I did. That's how I won the battle.

746
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,279
Star Wars face awesome times.

747
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,279
>> I love you, Anakin. Like a brother, you

748
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,960
were the chosen one.

749
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,559
>> Thank you, Jim, for that synopsis of the

750
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
movie.

751
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,520
Meanwhile, Anakin is just sizzling there

752
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,120
like a sausage. I hate you.

753
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
>> I want the director's cut.

754
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,880
>> I died.

755
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,240
>> The Disney lawyers coming in to make

756
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,039
sure you never talk about Star Wars

757
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
again.

758
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,080
>> I forget that Disney owns Star Wars now.

759
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,840
What a weird time.

760
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,039
>> I think we all try to forget that. Also,

761
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,360
there's many tanks pushing up in front

762
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,360
of me here.

763
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,919
I'm going to have to make a uh move

764
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,840
here.

765
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,279
>> Yeah. And it might be a contested move.

766
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,279
>> How many tanks are I going to drive over

767
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,279
here?

768
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,240
That's how I was spying on T18's gunner.

769
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,799
>> More than one.

770
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
>> I regret that decision. I got him a

771
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
party though. It was worth it.

772
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
>> My goodness.

773
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,240
>> There he goes again.

774
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,240
>> I may die, but he suffered and that is

775
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,320
okay with me. I sound really cool for

776
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,320
saying it like that.

777
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,279
>> No, it's an M18. It deserves it.

778
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,440
>> Okay. You just sound like you just

779
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,200
really dislike M18s. M18s are

780
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,840
technically an invasive species

781
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
depending on what map you're on.

782
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,960
>> I'm just finding it really funny that

783
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
I've already now like half a dozen M18s

784
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,559
today.

785
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,159
>> You're sinking them like three-pointers.

786
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,080
>> I see one tank in front of you right

787
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,960
there.

788
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,919
Bomb is away.

789
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,840
>> I have Yeah, there's also a heavy tank

790
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,919
to the Never mind.

791
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
>> That's two down.

792
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,279
Neither of those were heavy though. So,

793
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,840
is there another one or artillery

794
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,080
coming?

795
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,919
>> Wait, no. No. What? And then what did I

796
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,600
but they were

797
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,600
>> thick.

798
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
>> Hey, so I might have confused heavy tank

799
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,039
in the

800
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
>> What?

801
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,919
>> I blew up good.

802
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,720
>> What happened?

803
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,720
>> I blew up real good.

804
