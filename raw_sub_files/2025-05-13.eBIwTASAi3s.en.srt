1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,799
Oh, there's the revving. The nervous

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,280
revving of the engine. He's peeking.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,160
He's That was two. That works.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,799
He is down. Oh, nice shot. Uh, how's

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,400
Tiger Tiger? His barrel's up. His

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,000
barrel's back. Barrel's up. Barrel's up.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
I will sacrifice myself for the cause.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
He got shot in the face. He's down. Oh

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,000
my gosh.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
Where did you pen for monster? He got to

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
rub that belly under his belly. Get in

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
there and scratch it good. Oh my gosh. I

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,960
was too busy worrying a man out here

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,480
actually like petting tigers like

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,480
they're kittens. Ground forces video

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,520
1,00. That is a pretty crazy number to

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,600
me. And thank you so much for allowing

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,640
us to keep making content and allowing

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,719
us to hit such a crazy milestone. I want

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
to thank all the people who have helped

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
me create content. This certainly

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,879
doesn't just happen by myself. We have

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
the guys that show up in videos of

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,640
course, but there's also a lot of people

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,960
who never get a second of screen time

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,840
that are the unsung heroes of this

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,479
channel community from community

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,320
managers, Discord moderators, Twitch

29
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:13,600
moderators, people who have donated

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,720
resources, time, expertise, and skills

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,119
to help us do this. And they are the

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
unsung heroes of the channel. and I want

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,920
to thank all of them for any and all

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
contributions they have made to allow us

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,000
to reach this milestone. I also want to

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
take a quick moment and thank all of our

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,479
Patreon members, YouTube sponsors,

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,360
Twitch subscribers. Your generosity has

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,360
made all this possible. Thank you so

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,680
much to an amazing community for

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,439
continuing to support us all these years

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
and allowing us to keep going. I can't

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,439
express that enough. You guys have

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,840
absolutely blessed my life and have

45
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,680
allowed me to live my dream and I will

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
be forever thankful for that. So,

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
there's one last thing I like to talk

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,720
about before we get on to the subject of

49
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
today's video. And I'll be quite honest,

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,799
I record this part now like 10 times

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
because I can't find a way I want to say

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,360
this, but in the last video I mentioned,

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
hey, if you like the content, please

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,200
make sure to subscribe to the channel.

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,480
It really helps us out. And we had over

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,040
200 subscribers in 40 hours. I can't

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
tell you how much that has meant to me.

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,400
It has been an absolute slog on YouTube

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,959
the past year and a half. And I'll throw

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,440
the recent analytics on the screen there

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
for the recent subscribers. I don't want

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
to get too much in the numbers or get

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
too far into this, but I'm sure you've

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,959
heard other YouTubers talk about just

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
how the platform has been lately for us.

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,640
And uh thank you so much for just doing

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
that. That helps us so much. And again,

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll mention if you like the content, if

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
you like to see us make more, please

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,480
make sure to subscribe. If there's other

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,560
content creators out there that you

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,800
enjoy watching, please subscribe to

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
them. It really helps us out. So,

74
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
hopefully that didn't come off too

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
awkward because it felt really awkward

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
to me. I hate talking about this stuff

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
and I'm definitely a person who never

78
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
likes asking for anything. So, thank you

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,519
so much again for the support. So, I

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,840
have what I wanted to say off my chest.

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,879
And now, let's get on to the subject of

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,440
today's video. In the previous video, I

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,400
asked, "What would you like to see for

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,200
our 1,000th Ground Forces video?" The

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
winning comment with 2500 likes is

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
whatever vehicle you did your first vid

87
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
with for War Thunder or choose your

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
favorite vehicle to play. So, we decided

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,159
to do a combo video. The first kind of

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,319
proper ground forces video I did, and I

91
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,440
say proper very loosely, would be the

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,959
KB2. And that's a classic. Now for the

93
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000
favorite part, nothing jumped out to me

94
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,920
immediately, but I thought about it for

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,640
a few minutes and there is a MBT that I

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,159
have over 600 battles in. And when I say

97
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,319
MBT, I mean mini battle tank, the M22

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,840
Locust. Let's get that Gremlin energy

99
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
going. So, if you haven't figured out

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,159
from the thumbnail already, we're going

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,760
to be doing a KV2 and M22 Locust

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,599
combination video. So, there's going to

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,760
be two rounds of KV2 and then we're

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,519
going to jump over to the M22 Locust and

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,400
run it at a bunch of different battle

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,200
ratings, including top tier and a couple

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
really fun rounds at 6.0 and 7.0. I know

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
at this point you're probably sick and

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,359
tired of hearing me say thank you, but

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,959
we had such a overwhelming response in

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,199
the last video in terms of comments and

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,240
ideas for what we should do for this

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,600
video that even if your idea wasn't

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,080
picked for this video, you still may see

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,479
your idea resurface in the future

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,360
because there were some really good

117
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,520
ideas that we're going to draw

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
inspiration from and use in the near

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,440
future. So, thank you so much to all

120
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
those who contributed in the comment

121
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,199
section last video. There was a lot of

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
gold in there. And now with all that

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,000
being said, I think it's time to just

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
simply start the video before I talk

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
forever. Well, there's something I need

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,800
to admit to you. You're disappointed in

127
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,919
Nissan? No, I'm disappointed in uh

128
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,720
Midwestern barbecue.

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,880
Okay, that's a take. My My loving mother

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
for Mother's Day wanted barbecue.

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Immediately threw your mom under the bus

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
on this

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Also, take way out there. That's not

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,400
very loving, Jim. Well, he's a grown

135
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,240
woman. I'm a grown man. We can we can

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
take the

137
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,120
L's. She wanted a barbecue from this new

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,560
barbecue place. Okay. Fast forward $120

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,919
later and about 50 lbs of

140
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,639
food. I realized that. Could someone

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,639
please murder that? Uh, I'll try. I

142
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,360
realize us Midwesterners, we do not know

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,560
how to do brisket.

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,639
No, you you needed up to spend 130 bucks

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,039
to learn that. Well, I love my mother

146
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,680
very much and she wanted brisket and I

147
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,800
proceeded to consume about 5 lbs of

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,680
shredded spare tire with Alabama white

149
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,039
sauce. The Alabama white sauce made it

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,639
palatable and I realized that we really

151
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,199
really should leave brisket to everyone

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,400
from Kansas down to Texas. My face right

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:03,320
now is a lot of confusion. I A puts

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,320
white sauce on B $130.

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,039
I My family eats a lot of food. It

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,560
wasn't just for like me and my mom. It

157
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,000
was like for the rest of my family. Come

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,520
down here. I'll cook you a brisket for

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,520
$130.

160
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Okay.

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,199
Also, that corner is clear now.

162
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
I got shot from because there's one

163
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,440
behind us. Don't jump. I'm trying to

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
turn. You confused me so much. I drove

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,080
right past that Sherman. And I

166
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,400
apologize. Oh my gosh. Yeah, he's hiding

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,039
in damaged.

168
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Not enough. Oh no. Okay, I have a 30

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,400
second repair. I'm going to keep staring

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,600
in front of him.

171
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,199
I was going to say you can use me for

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,240
cover. I'm going to block for you.

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,440
Actually, I got him out of the

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,560
apparently. I was able to fire, but it

175
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
did nothing. Jim, behind us, there's

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,840
another Sherman. Oh no. 50 second

177
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
repair. That one drove off. How's the

178
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,000
one in front of us doing? Uh, he he he

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
drove off like There's one to your

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
right. I would not pull any more

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
forward. Okay, I cannot uh repair it in

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
6 seconds. Oh, I see him. Okay, it's an

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,599
M10 actually.

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
You have that side cuz I have no ability

185
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,319
to slew turret. Okay, I am halfway

186
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
reloaded. Oh, I'm sorry. You're fine.

187
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,960
I'm trying to cover your six right now.

188
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,199
I am dead, which was a dream of mine.

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,240
Good news is uh good news there is no

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,680
good news, Jim. Okay, never mind. I I

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
reject that statement. You got ripped

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,039
off on some Alabama white sauce brisket

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
and we failed. I'm gonna bomb the guy on

194
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,680
A first. I'll come back around for you.

195
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,759
Actually, there's a bunch of them there.

196
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,080
So, two

197
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,960
bombs. Four targets there. These should

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
fall good.

199
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,160
There's five.

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,880
Excellent bomb. Unfortunately, the

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,199
flying wasn't as good. I'm going down.

202
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Oh no. Jim plane over you. You see him?

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,080
Yeah, I do.

204
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
Oh, there's the revving. The nervous

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,599
revving of the engine. He's peeking.

206
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,199
He's That was two. That works. Whoa.

207
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:06,199
Okay. Oh my.

208
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,199
And reloading again. The KV2 experience.

209
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,400
Hey, look at that. The parade is gone.

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm going to have to make my way to

211
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,160
Bravo here in a second.

212
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,599
I'd be happy to join you. What are you

213
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,240
in? T34 BT5. Never mind. Yeah, BT5. A

214
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,960
sport model. Why do you say BT5 and

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,280
start laughing sick? It's this miniature

216
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,680
team. Oh, you're gone. You just

217
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,919
kidnapped. Maybe that might be why Jim I

218
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,120
poked out of my little hideyhole for 5

219
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,919
seconds and then Okay. All right. Thank

220
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,919
you. No problem.

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,919
Unfortunately, he had friends. Oh, no.

222
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,200
As much as I do love KV2, it is not the

223
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,560
optimal tank to try and hold an entire

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
city by yourself when there's multiple

225
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
targets.

226
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
Think of the anxiety of loading that

227
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,680
giant shell back in that that breach. I

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
see that guy in the corner. He's down.

229
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Very nice. One flanked around here to

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,320
the right. He's pushing fast. Okay, I

231
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,480
got a sto. I can't do anything to stop

232
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,040
him. Good job, Jim. Thank you. Thank

233
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,040
you. Thank you. Oh, yep. He's He's just

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,200
going to cross the street. I'm watching

235
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,399
one right there, one close to me here.

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
Okay, I'm going to try to angle and get

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
the shell to have a shell loaded so I

238
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,040
can stop some of these. I'm marking a

239
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,480
map for team. That one's right there.

240
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,640
Looking at your marks. I'm Oh god. I

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,160
leave that one to the KV1 if you can.

242
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,399
Focus on the panc of you.

243
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm actually going to help that. All

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
right, that is done. That noise has been

245
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,800
put to rest. Okay, thank you. I'm going

246
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,560
to help him repair his barrel. Set

247
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,800
danger right there on that line. I'm

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,200
almost reloading my barrel once. Uhoh.

249
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Where's the me? Uh, right here. There's

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,240
a lot of ammo in like 25 square ft here.

251
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
So, yeah. There's also there's a lot of

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,240
fences in that way, Jim. So, if you

253
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,320
can't take You got right there. I got

254
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
him. Nice work. I used the uh I used the

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
sap shell. So, I was able to get through

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,360
that fence. KV1 has a repair, but he'll

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,080
be done before we get to him.

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,200
So, do you know why I picked a KV2 as

259
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,839
like one of the first things I play in

260
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,360
ground forces CBT back in the day? No,

261
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,720
let us know. I was kind of obsessed with

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,519
the KV2 in Company Heroes 2 cuz it was a

263
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,839
nuisance and a static defensive posture.

264
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,079
I see. And I was like, "Oh, it's not War

265
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,440
Thunder."

266
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,200
So, the obsession kind of just

267
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
transferred to this game. I think

268
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,079
everyone went through their KB2 phase

269
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,240
where they realized that this this

270
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
vehicle was so comically silly that it

271
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
actually existed and it has some really

272
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,000
good lore. It's just a phase bomb. My

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,160
favorite KB2 lore was it that was there

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,880
not a KB2 that held a road for 3 days

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,880
during the uh Winter War. I wasn't

276
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
there, but I I can't confirm that. Okay.

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,160
I know there was something. Yeah, I've

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,720
heard the story. I'm just making

279
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,279
Yeah. Uh, that was from front

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,279
firefly down

281
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,640
the street behind the pharmacy. Why did

282
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,959
I shoot that apartment complex? Not the

283
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,880
chaffy. What's wrong with me right

284
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,600
there? You got a friendly KB1 behind you

285
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
trying to get a shot. Maybe I snapshot

286
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279
that so quickly. I don't know why I did

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
that. Okay, friendly uh KB1 is uh

288
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,279
repairing you. That's okay. No, no, no.

289
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
Let's get old together. Also, I realized

290
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
you have right there. What? Jim, you're

291
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
left. What?

292
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah, getting old together didn't really

293
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,600
work out, did it? I was distracted by

294
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,519
the drinks on your fender. Forever

295
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,920
alone. Those are molotov cocktails, my

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
man. Those aren't for drinking. Oh,

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,279
there's gasoline in there. Well, I mean,

298
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,720
there's a they're for a different type

299
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,240
of party.

300
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,079
Resist. That's another awesome Russian

301
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
lore that I love. The origin of the name

302
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,880
Molotov cocktail.

303
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,399
Please do

304
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,279
tell. Well, so as the

305
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,120
uh Russo Finnish war was kicking off, I

306
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,560
believe Molotov had to testify in front

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
of the League of Nations that no, we're

308
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,480
not bombing Finland. We're actually

309
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
dropping them food. Though the Finnish

310
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,680
caught wind of that, designed the

311
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,680
Molotov cocktail, and I quote, because

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,800
we thought Mr. Molotov would have a nice

313
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,079
drink with his

314
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,440
picnic. Though it may not be, I may be

315
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,440
leaving out some details, but that's

316
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,279
actually the uh TLDDR on that actually.

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,839
the worst thing that could possibly

318
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,839
finally found me.

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,800
You know, I often forget that the uh

320
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
Collia Sherman is a thing until I'm

321
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,160
brutally reminded that it is in fact a

322
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,440
thing. Jim, I'm looking forward to

323
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:36,360
seeing if the YouTube comments verify

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,360
your story as true or fiction.

325
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,800
Well, the best thing I can say is that

326
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,959
uh call it trucker history. Trucker

327
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,639
history. I tell it like a truck driving

328
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,760
story where I may exaggerate a couple

329
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
things, but at the end of the day, I

330
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,720
mostly got it right. And it's been

331
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,880
passed down through a couple of

332
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,600
truckers. Yeah. Through a couple CB

333
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,839
channels. I'm in danger.

334
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
Oh

335
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,680
no. Try to get to you, Pooky. Uh, just

336
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
drop art on me. I can't do that. I want

337
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
to start throwing molotov cocktails at

338
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,240
this chaffy. Yeah, please do that. I I

339
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,399
am a heavy tank. I have no no arty. Hey,

340
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,360
running away

341
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,600
there. Okay, I will have visual shortly

342
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
if I pass by a couple of these block

343
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,480
flats. So, for the second half of this

344
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,240
video, we're going to play my favorite

345
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,320
ground forces vehicle in War Thunder,

346
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
which is tough for me to like define

347
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
because there's like five to 10 I would

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,920
call my favorites. And I'm looking at my

349
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,600
service record. I'm kind of ashamed at

350
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,120
what it's M22, KV220, M18, Cobra King,

351
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,480
IS-6,

352
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,560
M43105, R3T20, KV1B, the Scorpion, and

353
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,720
the Panther 2.

354
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,279
I think I have a type. There's there's a

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,399
lot of like heavy tanks mixed in there.

356
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,800
So, you're telling me that as many years

357
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,480
as this game's been out, and this is

358
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,560
your thousandth video, the one ground

359
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,920
forces vehicle you have the most battle

360
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,880
in battles in is the M22 Locust. Yeah. I

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
don't know if I should be proud of that

362
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,839
or ashamed. I should be proud. That's a

363
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,160
proud thing. You know what? I like how

364
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
that's a hill you're willing to die on.

365
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,079
So, what battle rate you want to play

366
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,760
locust at?

367
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,639
And why is it 70? That's Oh, no. Why is

368
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
it 70? Because I have my Locust in a 70

369
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
lineup.

370
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
Why?

371
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,120
Because it's fun. I promise you it's

372
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,040
fun. Here. Here we go, Jim. Okay. I

373
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,959
Okay. Did you find a bigon? Oh my gosh.

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
I found a big Yeah, that's the sounds I

375
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,959
was listening to. I'm sorry. That's

376
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,279
okay. Oh, Jim, where was it?

377
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,639
Hiding in a building. Hey, you pick on

378
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:51,519
me. Come back

379
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:55,040
here. I got the first one.

380
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,480
There's so many. I hear so many engines.

381
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,639
I got the Rattel that was trying to get

382
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,639
behind you.

383
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
I think they're mad. There's one behind

384
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,279
me, by the way. If you could let through

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,800
the soft squishy things and kill the big

386
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,760
Soviet heavy things, I'd be very

387
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,560
appreciative. It's a Tiger 2 stick. Uh,

388
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,880
okay. Yep. I'm turning. Yep. Yep. Yep.

389
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,680
Yep. Cuz that one I don't want to rumble

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,519
with if I don't have to. Cannon and and

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,480
gunner.

392
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,000
Help him with the track if I

393
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,600
can. Hey, I need that guy to die. That's

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,639
scary to turn at me. Commander and

395
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,560
horizontal. I know. I know. I know. I'm

396
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,160
I'm You are way more stressed than I am.

397
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,160
You actually have a cannon for this

398
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,279
battery rating. Loader. Don't go back.

399
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,240
Go back. Don't. What was that?

400
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,760
There's two. Take a breath. You're okay.

401
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
I'm the one the locust. Why are you

402
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,440
stressed out? Cuz I have to keep you

403
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,199
alive. No, you don't. Take care of

404
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,480
yourself. I'm fine. I'm a

405
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,920
locust. They won't find you cute and

406
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,320
adorable. There it is. See, they just

407
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,720
execute you on the spot.

408
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,519
Nobody likes

409
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,720
T92s, but M22 fun and cute. Hi there,

410
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
sir.

411
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,160
Can I follow you? There's three of them

412
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,480
there. I know. I'm following him. Oh my

413
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,639
god. Jim, please help him. Uhoh. That

414
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,560
one follow me. I'm trying, but guess

415
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,880
what? I'm coming back in a locust.

416
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,079
I recently found out that there is bars

417
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,839
in Japan that celebrate, some would say

418
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,120
even worship Texans. Have you seen these

419
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,120
honky tons? I actually I've heard that

420
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,839
Texans have gone over there and they're

421
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,839
treated like celebrities for the night.

422
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
I mean, think about it.

423
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,560
You know what that means, Jim? I want to

424
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,920
go. We got to take B. You bail off trip

425
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,240
to Japan. I would be found

426
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,360
desirable at a bar for once in my life.

427
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,560
I got shot. I deserve that.

428
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,000
I deserve everything that's happened to

429
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
me right now for saying that. He He was

430
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,880
living in a fantasy and he's crumbling

431
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,959
down. Just like every anime fan when

432
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,759
they go mouth. That's awesome. What? I

433
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,120
got shot. Yeah, it's right there.

434
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,279
Jim, he don't look happy. What are we

435
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
going to do? I'm I'm ready to die by

436
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
you. Trying to live. Don't come back for

437
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
us. Oh god. Your bids flew over me.

438
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,000
Inappropriate.

439
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,559
That's That's very LWD. Jim, what do we

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,439
do about that? I'm fantasizing that I'm

441
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,360
at a maid cafe in Japan. Oh, well, each

442
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,000
to their own. It's your fantasy, not

443
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,919
mine. They They call me senpai and son.

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,120
I'm not going to I shouldn't repair you,

445
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,640
but I'm going to. Thank you. Can we go

446
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,919
to the Texas? The Texas. We're going to

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,000
run. That's what we're going to do.

448
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,520
Okay. I want I want to be in a better

449
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,520
place. Left is bad. Go right.

450
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
Understood.

451
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,679
Uh, left is very bad. Look at that guy.

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,520
It's here. Oh, it's a Ferdinand. I ain't

453
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,559
afraid of no ghost. You want to pick on

454
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
him? I kind of want to pick on him.

455
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,280
Yeah, he ran into a wall. Let me Can we

456
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,080
get his ankles? I'll go for the right

457
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,840
one. Oops. I missed. I didn't do

458
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
anything to him. Here. What if we go

459
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,320
this way? Hang on. I wonder if he's

460
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,280
going to be pointing at us. Let me see.

461
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,480
Let me see. Let me see.

462
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Where are he?

463
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,640
I don't know. He's behind this building.

464
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
I don't see him yet.

465
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Take a little peek. Oh, yeah. He's right

466
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,160
there, Jim. Oh,

467
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,400
I got a machine gunner. Take that. I'm

468
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
going around him. He just murdered you.

469
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,520
Oh, yes, he did. See, you have the

470
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
advantage. You're close. I have the

471
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,039
Yeah, I don't feel like I have an

472
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,039
advantage here.

473
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,520
Lower. Uh, Jim. Yes. We're going to need

474
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,919
to call somebody. Yeah. Can we call

475
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,200
Thank you, Stick. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

476
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,960
You almost killed me though, but I

477
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,400
appreciate it.

478
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:39,440
Look, you got to live. You don't get to

479
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:45,000
complain. You took my track, sir.

480
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,000
Also, it's still not safe here. I know,

481
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,280
but I'd like to go now. It could be

482
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,120
safer. I'd really like to go now.

483
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
Where where are we going to go? It's not

484
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,760
going anywhere. That's not an option.

485
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
Actually, here's a hot take. So, the

486
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,320
halftrack I'm in. You know what this

487
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,760
thing actually is to me in in the year

488
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,000
of our Lord 2025? An off-road vehicle.

489
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,000
No. The most overpriced Facebook

490
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,520
marketplace thing in the world. Everyone

491
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,919
who has one of these and they put them

492
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
on marketplace thinks they go for 60

493
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,559
grand. Well, yeah, Jim, they do. No,

494
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,640
they do not. Yeah, they do, Jim. They're

495
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,679
It's It's history.

496
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,919
Yeah, but when it has a when when the

497
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,000
dude is so lazy that he can't even put

498
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,600
the original drivetrain in there, he has

499
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,880
to put a 350 Chevy with a turbo 400

500
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,720
transmission and calls it quote unquote

501
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,360
all original bent to Normandy hery

502
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
dirtly dirt. No, it's not 60 grand. I

503
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
was thinking about gee, I wonder what I

504
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,919
could get realistically for my fully

505
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
built Nissan Frontier Overland vehicle.

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,799
The one you just bought? Yeah. and then

507
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,799
go buy a fully pristine 1979 Oldsmobile

508
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,160
Cutless Supreme Coupe in a very

509
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,760
beautiful blue down in

510
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,039
Chicago. I'll even send you the link. It

511
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,919
was actually beautiful. I'm like, I

512
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,640
would daily the heck out of that.

513
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,600
You know,

514
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,320
Jim, voices like this might be why we

515
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,720
don't have money. When I was a kid, my

516
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,600
parents had a 89 cutless that's less

517
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,840
desirable.

518
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
A 1993 Cutless Supreme saved my life

519
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,000
when I was a kid. I always I've always

520
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,360
appreciate Olden Bill for that.

521
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
Jim, I will let you pick what the next

522
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,480
battery when we play locust that is.

523
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
Well, since you've given me that kind of

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,520
power, let's rip the band-aid off and do

525
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,440
120. I like how you were like, "Oh, 70

526
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
is really high. Are you sure?" And then

527
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
you just push us straight to 12.

528
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,640
Sometimes you got to go the full boore,

529
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,799
man. I'm in a Locust. There's a

530
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,720
Challenger 2 to my left and I think I

531
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,480
You chose this. I asked what bettering

532
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,400
you wanted and you said 120. So here we

533
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
are. Well, you can't back out of this,

534
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,679
Jim. You're the one who put in the

535
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,679
application. Tank at the corner. I'm

536
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,919
alive. I mean, yeah, I'm alive. I fire

537
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,919
for effect. NBT's best tank, mini battle

538
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,240
tank, right? Yeah. Let Can we hide in

539
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,280
the corner together and cower? That's my

540
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,360
current plan. Let's pretend that like

541
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,440
we're props like we're we're like we're

542
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,120
that Buick over there. They're pushing

543
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
aggressively. Oh gosh. All right. That

544
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
Buick is a lot nicer looking than us.

545
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Jim, get ready for side shot. I like how

546
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,240
we're all three hiding behind the same

547
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,080
building here. I'm I'm ready for side

548
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,120
shot. Maybe to take out a track. They're

549
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,360
going around out here. I'm going to drop

550
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,799
Arty down the road from us or up the

551
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,960
road from us. I would drop the right

552
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,760
there on that guy. Already did. Thank

553
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,039
you. He just backed off.

554
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,120
Oh no. I wouldn't pee that. It's not.

555
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,200
It's in front of us on B.

556
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,280
Oh, he just

557
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,640
you're hiding even more over there now

558
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,280
cuz I can see me. Can you make it to me?

559
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,360
Cuz I can't make it to you.

560
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,640
It's safer over here. I promise.

561
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,679
That's Oh, there's two of them just

562
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,159
sitting there. Do not peek out. All

563
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,600
right. Yeah. Uh don't go more left than

564
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,679
Jim's body. See you. I already dropped

565
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
it over there. When do you get your RD

566
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,000
back?

567
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,919
Uh, I'm uh stick

568
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,360
places front front.

569
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,600
Good news. They picked me. This is

570
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,960
awkward.

571
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,320
Jim, to your front right. Trees are

572
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
falling down. Jim, around the corner.

573
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
Just drove past you. What do you mean?

574
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,679
Around the corner.

575
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,200
What? I was speaking about that one.

576
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,440
He wasn't supposed to do that. He was on

577
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,159
a mission to murder you. He really was.

578
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,679
And guess what? He's going to get my lab

579
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
a cuz that's the only thing I have

580
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,039
points for. Okay. Stick. Hey, can you

581
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,799
make it to this dumpster over here? It's

582
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,200
safe. I don't I maybe keep your head

583
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,200
down. Keep

584
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,000
moving. It's probably not safe over

585
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,159
here,

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,919
though. Let me take a little peek. Yeah,

587
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
don't go that way. Treat slow down.

588
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,360
Okay. So, should we go the other way?

589
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,600
Well, Mr. Murderface is over there, but

590
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,240
maybe he's distracted in full. Mr.

591
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Murderface? I saw what he did to you.

592
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,559
Yeah, he did very much over my face.

593
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,760
All right, pushing across. It seems

594
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,840
relatively safe. Relatively for now.

595
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,799
Pushing up here.

596
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,600
Was not safe. Huh? Oh no. Where'd that

597
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,840
come from? Behind you. Behind the rock.

598
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,840
The rock to your right. The rock to my

599
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,080
right. Something's

600
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,320
burning. A lot of rocks over here. Stick

601
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,720
marking a map. I'm kind of flanking

602
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,400
around. Thank

603
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,240
you. Okay. I think it's dead.

604
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,440
You think?

605
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,679
Yeah. I don't see anything else that's

606
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
uh moving that's alive. Jim, can I hang

607
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,840
out with you? Uh yeah. Let's get to more

608
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,640
cover here. My flank is exposed.

609
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,840
That's a little thing. What is it? I

610
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,679
don't know. It's quick and fast. It's

611
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,039
like a BMD. I'll push left. Okay. I hear

612
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah, it's moving this way. I might be

613
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,760
able to get it. Jim, that's not a BMD.

614
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,840
That's a TDU1.

615
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,200
Oh goodness. It was moving so fast I

616
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,960
couldn't really tell. I'm sorry. That

617
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,400
was the worst call I've had today.

618
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,039
It's been a while since top tier. I

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,840
apologize, sir. I thought I had a

620
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,600
chance. An MBT just drove past like He's

621
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,120
now speeding off, by the way. Oh,

622
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,120
really? Okay. Hit and run,

623
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,520
coward. I hear him. Yeah, he went down

624
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,200
there to the right.

625
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,679
I'm just watching my dead body. This is

626
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,679
very sad. Yeah, you'll come off that

627
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,080
way. They'll be to You just Jimmy's

628
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
coming back behind you. Behind me. He

629
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,640
just shot the guy that was following

630
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,640
you.

631
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
I got him. I won. Good job. I'm proud of

632
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
you. I'm the best. Giving you a thumbs

633
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,120
up. You can't see it. Thank you. No, I

634
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
appreciate it. I'm going to go try to

635
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,640
capture A now and probably die. Have a

636
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,159
nice life as you explode.

637
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,240
What hit you? Uh, their AA hit me with a

638
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,080
freaking like anti-ship missile. So,

639
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,840
after that traumatic experience, it is

640
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,120
your choice, stick boy, at what battle

641
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,120
rating we play the Locust. Oh, I No, we

642
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,840
we should go to its

643
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:17,039
home nice and safe and and be effective

644
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,559
teammates and go down to 2.0. You just

645
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,000
want to live more in 14 seconds.

646
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,279
That actually makes a lot of sense. I

647
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,840
agree with Stick, actually. Hey, Jim.

648
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,679
Yes. Thick said 2.0.

649
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,159
Yes, he did. What was in your lineup?

650
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,159
M1 A1HC.

651
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,640
So, uh,

652
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,640
Jim, that's um,

653
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,840
why do you want to hurt me? I It was an

654
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:53,200
accident. I was distracted because my M1

655
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,720
A2 SE was screw locked and so so I

656
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
swapped it out. I said, I'm ready to go.

657
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,279
I forgot I brought the other Abrams.

658
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,039
Jim, the team is not happy with us. I I

659
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,760
know they're not. They can They can

660
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,760
write a complaint to

661
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:09,200
corporate that. Okay. I I I deserve

662
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,039
that. You two instantly perish.

663
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
Yep. Meanwhile, I've been adopted by an

664
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,600
Abrams. And where I've gone, he's gone.

665
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,760
And he keeps trying to protect me. And I

666
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,120
appreciate

667
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,320
that. If I stop moving, he stops

668
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,600
moving. I'm his emotional support

669
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,240
locust. I found a home.

670
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll peek the corner for him.

671
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,880
Be careful. There's a lot in that city.

672
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,320
As you say that, the poor Leopard 284

673
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,279
next to me has uh

674
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,159
vanished. I mean, the tank is still

675
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,080
there. The people inside are no

676
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,200
longer. The Abrams has left

677
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,000
me. One pushing in the corner at me,

678
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:54,080
too. This is not good. Abrams,

679
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,520
I heard the A factory is having a

680
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,600
lowercase A special just for us. It only

681
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,640
makes sense we get this map for 1,000

682
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,720
ground forces videos.

683
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,440
Welcome back to the another exciting

684
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,919
summer season of the Aactory Tours,

685
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
where we have a special on all forms of

686
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,000
lowercase A's, including bold and

687
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,679
italicized. What about comics hands?

688
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Sorry, that was yesterday.

689
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,480
Tacoma.

690
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,919
No,

691
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,919
sir. Please hold your questions till I

692
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
can't drive.

693
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,679
That's what I get for saying comic

694
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,320
sands. Yeah. Pushing through there.

695
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,080
Terrible. Oh, hey Jim. I would hide. I'm

696
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,039
hiding. I'm hiding. I'm hiding. Where

697
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,520
are we hiding from? Hiding. Contact

698
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,600
close right to me. T28 entering by the

699
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,520
pipes.

700
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,880
Okay. Moving up behind Bo to get a shot.

701
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,360
I'm just trying to push up as far as I

702
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,799
can.

703
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,080
I got a lot of movement to my close

704
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:57,520
right over here. Yep. Yeah. I'm not sure

705
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,840
how my six is looking.

706
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
One immediate right of me. Okay. I just

707
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,640
realized I was actually following stick

708
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,480
and not you, Bo. That's

709
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,760
okay. Hi, Jim. I'm hiding with you. Oh

710
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,039
my gosh, there's a big gray beast out

711
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,320
there. I'd recommend you two pushing

712
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,399
that side if you can. Just flank around.

713
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,279
I'll hold this corner. That's a good

714
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:17,679
idea. Actually, I might push for this

715
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:21,159
guy.

716
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:25,159
I see one running out from over

717
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:29,360
there. That is a Stewart maybe or M2 and

718
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:32,480
AA coming up from this side back here.

719
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
Okay, me and Jim are pushing around now.

720
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,440
I'm just kind of in intelligence

721
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
gathering mode right now. Thank you.

722
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,200
Thank you.

723
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
You guys good over here? Yeah, I'm just

724
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600
waiting for the artillery to kill me.

725
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,000
It's a lot of orange smoke by me. All

726
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,640
right, next push is over here. Friendly

727
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,360
to me just died. Careful stick. moving.

728
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,760
Oh, I I am not stopping. Don't worry

729
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,039
about that. My shot's no good. Mark

730
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,000
right there. Stick

731
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,159
ricocheted. I like how he wasn't even

732
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,520
distracted by you.

733
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,720
Waiting for you to finish. Got his crew.

734
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,640
Got his crew. I don't have a gunner.

735
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,399
I have no angle. Oh god. Stick. Bad

736
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,559
things are happening. Stick is knife

737
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,960
fighting that guy.

738
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,120
Need help over there. All good. He's

739
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:18,000
down. Okay, good. BT over here. I have

740
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,200
no shot. Sorry. Bad mark. Okay. I'm

741
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
trying to look. Trying to look. BT is

742
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,760
sitting right there. Okay. I also have

743
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,440
no shot. I'm too far back. I'm hoping

744
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
you can't see the top of us. Okay. There

745
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,679
may be something right here. I need to

746
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,960
look. I just got shot on the back.

747
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,760
Looking for it. Turning. Turning. Or

748
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,279
that could have been from the right.

749
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,399
Just glanced off me. Oh, it was it was

750
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,919
in here. So, I'm not crazy. He's hiding.

751
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,159
He's hiding with the machinery. It's a

752
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,080
Stewart. I thought there was a couple.

753
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,159
Got an engine. Engine on him. Gunner.

754
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,240
What? One swarm. There's so many of us.

755
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,760
Okay, bounced off. Come on. Nice kill

756
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,520
stick. Holy moly. All right, now now all

757
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,240
our teammates are here. I broke my

758
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,840
transmission on that. Oh, stick. I got

759
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,120
him.

760
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,039
All right, I'm hiding in the building

761
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,440
because I'm scared. Oh, hi. Another

762
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,360
locus came in. This is getting a little

763
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,240
weird. Yeah, I'm not that Locust. Please

764
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,000
do not call me that

765
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:13,200
Locust. I think he's watch. I'm not

766
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,159
sure. I I I don't I don't really know.

767
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,919
We got teammates wishing Bravo. So, we

768
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,840
either help defend A or move down

769
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,559
towards B and C. There's going to be a

770
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,440
thing. Hello here.

771
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,679
I hear bombs. Big Japanese. Big

772
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,159
Japanese. I think that's a ho, Jim.

773
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,320
Hoor. Yes. Thank you. I I had forgotten.

774
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,880
All right. He's down.

775
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,960
Oh god. Can left. Oh god. I'm sorry. I

776
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,200
sorry. I'm sorry.

777
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,679
Sorry. I'll get beside you. Jim, I'm

778
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Things

779
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,080
happen. I was trying to keep IKV alive

780
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,360
since I kind of got in his way. Stick

781
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
right there behind that. When you're

782
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,760
tiny and fast, things happens. And autoc

783
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,520
can to your front left. Yep.

784
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,919
I can't see the guy behind

785
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,279
there. Thank you for killing that.

786
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
Uh-huh. I'm going to go get a crew

787
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,559
member now.

788
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,600
I could use one as

789
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:12,760
well. Let me mark this guy on map for

790
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,760
the IKV.

791
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,960
and I'll make my way to

792
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,600
you. Jim, your tour didn't really uh go

793
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,440
well there. Oh, it was actually awful.

794
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,799
The uh the AAC has actually been caught

795
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
slipping on a lot of their tours.

796
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,440
They're having a lot of industrial

797
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,679
accidents as of late.

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,360
What kind of safety standards do you

799
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,720
have around here?

800
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,039
Well, there was a lawsuit here, a

801
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,120
lawsuit there. Uh, they actually hired a

802
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,080
safety guy. That really should not have

803
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,159
been the safety guy.

804
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,919
Was it you? It's a long story. I'm

805
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,840
actually waiting for a uh a drama

806
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,320
YouTuber to come out with a video essay

807
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,440
uh bomb uh on the uh Just kidding. Never

808
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,200
mind. It was just plain freaking me out.

809
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
Just kidding. You can't say that as I'm

810
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,039
stuck here getting a crew member. I

811
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,399
looked up and I saw this big old plane

812
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,679
and I was waiting for the bomb and I

813
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,039
realized that he was just waving off.

814
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,880
But yeah, no, I'm actually waiting for a

815
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,760
drama tuber to drop like a 90-minute

816
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,640
video on like the fall of the aactory.

817
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,279
What they don't want you to know. Are

818
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,279
both of you okay? Oh, I'm perfectly

819
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,200
fine. I think Jim's having a little bit

820
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,200
of a moment.

821
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,039
Bomb is here. Oh. Oh gosh. All right,

822
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,880
we're good. No stick. We're not good. We

823
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,320
are absolutely not good. You're on fire.

824
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,440
You're on fire. Put yourself out. Let me

825
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,039
fix you. I'm getting I'm getting now.

826
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,880
You're dead. Jim, maneuver kill. BT BT

827
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,399
engine radiator BT5. I cannot see the

828
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,320
BT. There's a flaming airplane in front

829
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,960
of me. Don't worry, I got it anymore.

830
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,080
God, I hope not. I don't want to be here

831
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,519
anymore. Yeah, let's go to the B point.

832
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,120
We're abandoning the A factory and going

833
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,279
to the Bravo factory. I don't think the

834
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,559
B point is safe either,

835
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,159
Jim. At this point, I think it's the

836
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,679
fact that we're all together. I think

837
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,640
the B factory has better food,

838
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,640
personally.

839
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
How y'all doing? Welcome to the B

840
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,080
factory. We make all farms the letter B.

841
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,519
It's a different voice. Of course it is.

842
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,559
You think it wasn't going to be a

843
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,559
different voice? We make cursive bees

844
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,000
and we make little bees and we make big

845
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,320
bees. I heard a thing that if you write

846
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,200
in cursive/ uh you know normal print

847
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,360
font, if you do the 50/50 thing, you

848
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,240
either had trauma as a child or you're a

849
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,840
serial killer. Really? I I didn't know

850
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,120
that. I as you know someone who's who

851
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,399
writes left-handed. I've been told

852
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,679
constantly that apparently I'm a

853
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,679
psychopath. But all right, whatever.

854
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,399
They don't know me. Oh, that's just cuz

855
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,399
you write left-handed, Jim. I need to

856
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,679
stop reading these theories. Also, what?

857
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,919
Wait, wait, wait. What? What kind of

858
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,880
trauma results in a person writing in

859
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,519
cursive and regular at the same time? Do

860
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,240
you write like that? Yeah. You've had a

861
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,720
lot of trauma. What kind of trauma?

862
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,480
Childhood trauma. Oh no, my barrel's

863
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,880
out. Help. Help me. Can we get a mark

864
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,960
where that target is? Uh, end of the

865
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,519
railroad tracks.

866
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,519
It just got you.

867
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,560
Have you ever heard of the broken bone

868
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,639
theory as well?

869
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,800
Like if you've broken a bone? Yeah. If

870
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,960
you've never broken a bone, that means

871
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,919
you're going to have a life of emotional

872
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,839
trauma.

873
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,359
But I've never broken a bone. I've

874
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,879
cracked bones, but I've never like

875
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,200
straight up like broken a bone in half

876
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,720
where I need a cast. I've had

877
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,960
reconstructive knee surgery. What does

878
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,040
that count for?

879
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,280
You play football? Wait. Yeah. Do I just

880
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,879
have a lot of trauma? Should I stop

881
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
telling you these theories? Are we

882
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,280
having a moment with stick where he

883
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
Every single one is my truth? Oh gosh.

884
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,960
So, now that we're out that match, I can

885
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,879
actually properly read to you more on

886
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,359
what this theory is. So, the never broke

887
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,960
a bone theory suggests that a person who

888
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,839
has not yet broken a bone in their body

889
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,399
at any point in their life is said to be

890
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,440
made or is meant to experience immense

891
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
physical, emotional, and spiritual

892
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,079
challenges. That make you feel any

893
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,760
better? No. I've never broken a bone.

894
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,160
Also, for our last match in Locust,

895
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,400
we're going to do 6 because that is the,

896
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,640
in my opinion, the most fun bat rating

897
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,520
for Locust. Personally cannot wait to

898
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,760
bully all the German heavy tanks.

899
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Panthers are actually really fun to rats

900
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,680
in the

901
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,440
Locust. That's my favorite target. First

902
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,480
off, I' like to apologize for the map we

903
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:31,040
got. Oh god. Secondly, I'd like to just

904
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,079
make a note that the Locust is very much

905
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,480
trash panda energy as

906
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,720
well. It's kind of cute, you know, looks

907
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
docile. Get close to it, it might rip

908
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
your finger off.

909
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
Can we find a dumpster on the A point,

910
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
please?

911
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,079
Jim, I don't know if we're going to make

912
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,880
it across that field, but I'm going to

913
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,040
just run straight at the cat point. Me,

914
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,640
too.

915
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,000
It'll be like the last of the

916
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Boheans. That was a reference that I

917
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,119
don't think Stick will ever have a

918
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,040
chance at getting.

919
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,920
I'm glad you understand when you made

920
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,200
that that you knew I

921
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,599
didn't. And you should see it. You

922
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,040
should watch that movie.

923
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
I feel like at this point we're just

924
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,720
going to need to make a list of all the

925
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
movies that you think I should watch.

926
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,760
Jimmy, you got that reference right,

927
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,920
please.

928
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,160
Totally, buddy. You've never heard of

929
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,359
Last of the Moheakans, the movie. Oh,

930
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,520
Moheakans. I thought you were saying

931
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,599
Boheans. I said last weekend. It was a

932
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,520
pun.

933
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,680
Oh, because of what's about to happen to

934
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,079
us. Okay. I try to make good references.

935
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,400
I'm I just You try You try to raise

936
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
them, right? You know, it's okay. I I I

937
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,320
know things that some people don't know

938
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,320
either. It's okay. It's all about things

939
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,800
on the point.

940
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,960
Yeah, I see right here. I messed up. I'm

941
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,160
sorry. Goodbye. What is it? What is it?

942
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,599
Oh jeez. He just fired. Swarm. I got his

943
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,480
engine machine gunner transmission.

944
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,160
Okay. I

945
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,560
Somebody's got him right before he fires

946
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
again. Commander. Commander, he's down.

947
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,480
Okay. Good job. Good job. Hiding places,

948
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,440
everybody. Hiding places. Okay. Uh, can

949
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,520
somebody stay in the cap if they can

950
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,280
find a spot? Yep. I'll find a I'll stay.

951
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,079
I'll stay. Yeah. Let me uh I think I

952
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,839
need a small repair here. Please be

953
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,160
small. Just kidding. It's a 30 secondond

954
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,960
repair.

955
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm looking for targets pushing us.

956
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,320
Thank you, sick. They're all up

957
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,640
here. Drop already on that mark if you

958
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,760
can.

959
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,040
Hey, I'm also going to get a crew member

960
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,880
cuz that really really hurt that first

961
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,119
round. So far, all I'm seeing is tigers.

962
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,599
That's the bad news. I We can't do

963
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,640
tigers. It's out of my pay grade. Yeah.

964
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,040
The problem is it's like there's five

965
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,680
tigers. Oh yeah, it's actually pretty

966
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,040
bad. Couple of them are down.

967
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,880
They're just Cresting Hill looking for

968
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,800
us right now. See what what what big

969
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,040
brother Sherman told me is that like

970
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,400
there's only one Tiger. Can you call Big

971
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,000
Brother Sherman? Uh, no. I think he

972
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,040
blocked me. Tiger on me. Push you in

973
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,280
this corner. Uh, firing for effect.

974
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,079
Prepare yourself.

975
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Uh, his track just kicked that. Don't

976
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,000
worry, he turned. Yeah. Oh, he's coming

977
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,800
towards you. He's coming towards you.

978
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I didn't expect him to

979
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
go this way. Coming towards you. He's

980
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,560
coming towards you.

981
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,240
He's on me. Okay. I'm I'm trying to I'm

982
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,920
trying to He's focused on me.

983
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,160
Repositioning. Repositioning. Can you

984
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,280
take his barrel or something? Uh uh uh.

985
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Come

986
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,599
on. Get the gun up. Get the gun up. I'd

987
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
like to disappear before he fires again.

988
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,560
I'm okay. My tracks also. His barrel's

989
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,760
gone. His barrel's gone. I'm

990
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,680
repairing. His friends may get frisky

991
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,240
and push as well. Okay, I'm going to try

992
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,480
to mark a map. Try to take his tracks.

993
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,960
Try to take his tracks. Bomb is falling.

994
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,720
Oh gosh. Please.

995
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,880
Uh yeah, we have company here,

996
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,280
gentlemen. Something there. I I see we

997
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,800
do. I'm holding fire for now. Hey, I'm

998
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,320
going to back off before that barrel

999
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
comes back online and murders. Panther.

1000
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,280
The Panther's here. The Panther? What do

1001
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
you mean the panther's here? Panther's

1002
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,960
here. Oh, the Panther's here. Driver on

1003
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,040
him. Hey, nothing on him. Driver,

1004
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,359
gunner,

1005
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,200
loader. He is down. Oh, nice shot. Uh,

1006
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,839
how's Tiger? Tiger, can we kill this

1007
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,920
tiger? His barrel. I will sacrifice

1008
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,160
myself for the cause.

1009
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,000
He got shot in the face. He's down. Oh

1010
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,720
my gosh.

1011
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,079
Where did you pen from? Under his belly.

1012
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,400
Under his belly. You got to rub that

1013
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,119
belly. Oh my gosh. Get in there and

1014
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,240
scratch it man out here actually like

1015
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,280
petting tiger. I told you 6 is the best

1016
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,040
battle rating for Locust.

1017
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Do you believe me? Now I can already

1018
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,119
hear Tiger and and Panther mains like

1019
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,720
just grinding their teeth. And we are

1020
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,040
going to get bombed so hard. We need to

1021
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,400
like find a new spot. Uh, I don't want

1022
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,160
to. Where are we going to go?

1023
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,800
Into the forest. We're going to become

1024
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,240
like forest creatures. He did say we

1025
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,440
were raccoons. Yeah, we're little

1026
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,079
whimsical creatures. That's what we are.

1027
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,079
Returning to our roots.

1028
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,760
You're getting a little brave peeking

1029
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,440
like that. I

1030
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,680
am. I I'm I'm just waiting for something

1031
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,560
like that's very thin skin to crest the

1032
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,839
hill like a dick or

1033
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,960
Max. Part of me wants to run down there

1034
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,839
and harass the things they're going

1035
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,359
around us, but also our defensive A has

1036
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,760
been so good. I don't want to leave and

1037
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,280
lose it. I mean, we we we kind of are

1038
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,920
the team, I think. Uh, gentlemen,

1039
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,599
incoming. Incoming. Incoming. 236. 236.

1040
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,440
236.

1041
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,200
Yeah. So, I don't fight that. That is an

1042
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,599
Yeah, that's out of our pay grade. I

1043
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
shot at it to make it make myself feel

1044
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,800
better.

1045
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Did it work, Jim? He does have one

1046
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,359
reload. Yeah. So, I think we're going to

1047
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
be okay for about like 5 seconds.

1048
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,480
There's a Panther sitting right here

1049
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,640
beside me. I'm going to try to take him.

1050
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:44,320
Panther just shot. Okay. Pushing on his

1051
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,520
side. Gunner damaging his barrel.

1052
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,839
Shot out his barrel. I'm going to take

1053
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,119
his driver

1054
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:53,119
next if I

1055
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:55,400
can. All right. A little bit more left.

1056
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,520
There he goes. Oh,

1057
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,720
man. Amazing how you can surgically pick

1058
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
that apart. Hey, something over there.

1059
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,839
Yeah. I'm surprised I'm still alive

1060
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,000
right now. I thought for sure they would

1061
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,079
uh murder me.

1062
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,040
I mean, I guarantee you you have a hit.

1063
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,040
Looks like an ISU.

1064
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,359
Why am I looking at what Jim's looking

1065
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,280
at? Okay, there's there's going to be

1066
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,839
big things. There's a plane. Oh, okay.

1067
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,240
That almost landed on me.

1068
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,680
Galaxy.

1069
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,440
It's very strange getting best squad

1070
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,200
when we basically ran three locuses that

1071
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,200
entire time.

1072
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,800
pretty much. And I I I drove six feet in

1073
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,920
a Hellcat and that's really all I did

1074
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,280
today despite watching my friend

1075
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,680
surgically dissect panthers and tigers.

1076
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,480
Go for the soft sides, the love

1077
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,480
handles. I got to write that down.

1078
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:57,840
