parts on this vehicle what would you do

182
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,440

183
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,240
off-road bumper a winch

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,720
um a high lift jack oh yeah some better

185
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,080
tires i would say three inch lift uh

186
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,120
depending on kind of what you see you

187
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,480
and like you know licking our wounds

523
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,720

spooning or spooning

528
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,480
