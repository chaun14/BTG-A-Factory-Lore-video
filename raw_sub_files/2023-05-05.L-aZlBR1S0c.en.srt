207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,880
copyright

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,039
no eyes yeah there is there's just just

209
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,280
head towards B and you'll find them

210
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:20,819
eventually I'm almost to be

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,319
I see one on that building right there

212
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,099
I assume that's what you're talking

213
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,699
about

214
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,960
yep should be a t29 slash like p34 over

215
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,840
there I'm gonna guess there's other

216
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,580
things here too I think the t-34 was a

217
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,500
bit a bit more south

218
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,779
if you see that Mark on the map the one

219
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,339
that's like out there they're out God

220
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,320
for example I've got a tank right to my

221
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,659

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,120
