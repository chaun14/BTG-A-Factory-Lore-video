bomb well yes it was a

453
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,679
bomb you know what that plane would be

454
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,880
it would be uh what's that bird that

455
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,440

like I hope nobody comes for us for any

459
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,799
animal information we would make the wor

460
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,960
zoologist that's not true I know

461
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,960
penguins have

462
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,840
knees and they're in like a permanent

463
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,559
squat position most animals have

464
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,360
knees I mean a worm doesn't okay but I'm

465
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:53,840
say things that have legs typically have

466
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,360
knees I mean octopuses don't I just

467
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,760
learned human babies don't have kneecaps

468
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,000
though for a while those are arms oh

469
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,320
yeah they develop yeah kind weird I

470
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
think ducks have KNE

471
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,480
well they're Birds they it bends the

472
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,559

528
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,720
pandas like the black and white Pandas

529
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,880
where their patterns are semi randomized

530
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
and their eyes have a full circle around

531
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,480
them the brown panda

532
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,520
only get like extended coloration at the

533
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,400
