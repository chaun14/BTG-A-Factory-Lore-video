1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,520
due to recent changes in the a factory

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,859
structure we are closing down facilities

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,580
for today today we will take you on a

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,480
guided tour of our extra section the bee

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,080
Factory

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,300
do not worry because B comes after a it

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,140
is not second to the quality of the a

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,359
factory the B Factory is the toughest of

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,939
qualities compared to the a factory I

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,220
think top tier broken stick

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,359
we may have to reboot Jim

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,359
is that an option

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,640
sometimes you have to make decisions in

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,020
life to decide if you're a monster or

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,719
not and I I I'm struggling with this one

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,700
he's so small and adorable

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,980
but if he shoots at me

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,660
I'm gonna have to do it

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,920

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,600

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,020

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480

you probably call security and report

34
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,460
that there is a Lost Child on the

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,580

where's it coming from

120
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,430
right here

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,430
[Music]

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
unsure of the second one oh my gosh what

123
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,880
in the world

124
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm gonna be honest it's behind us

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,600
location compromise oh gosh

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,540
I needed you to help me and you didn't

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,780
help me on top of Jim it's on top of Jim

128
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,699
he cannot penetrate myself

129
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,320
this is a quite the Sprint to try and

130
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,320
not save you because you just perished

131
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,919
we just both took each other's tracks

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,860
I I hope to reload I'm gonna take your

133
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,720
yeah we're gonna take that first

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,460
and then I'm gonna come down here and

135
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm gonna hurt you

136
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,360
it's nothing personal you're just a t80

137
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,380
it's my job

138
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,639
damn

139
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,800
yes

140
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,720
I think an important lesson has been

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,660
learned here today the t80s are slowly

142
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,060
getting to me we're on the way back

143
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,740
no no worries I'm just slowly

144
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,820
psychologically breaking because of them

145
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,699
we um we shouldn't fight Jim no I think

146
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,199
the the biggest lesson here is that you

147
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,880
are a terrible Knight you are not

148
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,039
capable of saving the princess because

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,919
you cannot save me

150
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,560
the princess is grander than I am

151
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,880
you are not worthy

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,280
actually I want to make a height to your

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,699
T-shirt call it hurts so good it hurts

154
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,380
so good yeah 11-7 Hurts So Good

155
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,000
we don't even have time to have a

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,100
personality we're just like take left

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,919

158
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,560

161
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,639
merging onto the battlefield requesting

162
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,620
direct support you know how hard it's

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,319
gonna be to be verbally the whirlpool

164
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,900

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,880
there's always a second t80

438
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,699

439
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,980
second t80 to the second t80 I'm not see

440
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:23,520

I'm still Captain Point there's one

490
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,000
behind me towards a

491
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:23,000
just remember we're surrounded

492
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,480
and you don't have The High Ground every

493
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,020
direction there's a threat

494
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,700
right there you got him thank you

495
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,960
man those things are terrifying even

496
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,600
when you're in neighborhood I just got

497
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,919
shot again

498
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,900
there's no cover in here

499
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm just gonna move over here now I hope

500
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,280
it doesn't see me you're trailing fuel

501
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,460
look at that I'm being shot from

502
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,600
my track can you see him no I don't I

503
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,059
cannot I dead there's two of them that's

504
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,559
why I was confused

506
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,600

one from their side

508
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,220
that's why no matter wherever I went

509
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,140
there was no cover makes sense now

510
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,059
