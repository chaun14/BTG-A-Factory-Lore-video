00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
in a british tank but it's american

385
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440

shooting the american tanks i'm very

387
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,200
perplexed

388
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,560
uh left yeah it's a little bit advising

389
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,639
to shoot the sherman because it's like

390
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,959
i'm shooting one of them i am a sherman

391
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,959
