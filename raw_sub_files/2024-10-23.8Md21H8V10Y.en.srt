1

here I may need some assist thank you so

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,719

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,519
horrible don't go around that corner

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,559

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,800
watched the murder no I'm fine is

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,920
someone just fired at you again okay I'm

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,760
not so

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,199
fine hey

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
B I just got killed by a Rollin three

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,240
anti-air missile in my 2s3

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,880
8 and I thought I was having a bad

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,320
night did you just hit the pillar and

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,200
flip

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,879
over you got to come up with a better

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:44,200
story uh I don't have a better story he

18
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,879
was dodging missiles I oh okay there you

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,840
go drive along the wall here and you're

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,399
flipped oh that actually worked okay

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,760
well I don't recommend that because

22
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,920
that's kind of kind of cringe man

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,640
no all I said is I want to make a

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,600
professional intro to this video said

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,080
you wanted be cool like a real YouTuber

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,680
look all I want to do was talk about the

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,240
2s 38 and the upcoming the anniversary

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,680
cell right the one that happens every

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,520
year and whether people should uh spend

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,320
their hard-earned money on a 2s 38 or

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,280
not even the t72 terms or the tud I

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,159
assume all these are going to be

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,759
probably on Deep Discount um yes because

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,560
they are all going to be within that

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,960
period so if they do the high tier stuff

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,280
pretty much all of that's going to be

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,560
50% off right and we've never done a 2s

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,840
38 video it's been featured in other

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,520
videos but we've never done a 2s 38

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,640
video um the reason why I didn't do one

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,560
when it first came out was because I

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,240
felt it was extremely overpowered and I

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,439
tend to shy away from doing videos on

44
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,119
things I feel are just super op you're

45
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,799
broken stuff like that this was I think

46
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,759
this was very broken was first added and

47
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,360
that's why it kind of has

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,880
the reputation of just being dominant

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,240
since then and storms can go through the

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,960
changes on 2s 38 it is no longer the

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,479
dominant Beast that it once was when it

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,200
for Saturn it still has the potential to

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,800
be very good um and incredibly annoying

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,400
to enemies that face it but it's just

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
not as domineering as it was most people

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,920
have figured out how to deal with them

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
since you know it's been in the game for

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,319
what two years now um it it's definitely

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,319
been a tiger that has been declawed yes

60
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,319
it's still a great well it it's still a

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,040
great vehicle it's just it's not

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,000
blatantly overpowered any longer it's a

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,000
fantastic antire the hvt round is

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,280
phenomenal great at smacking helicopters

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,200
I have a quick clip I'll put in here of

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,879
that I mean oh God more expensive but

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,920
only because they come with a container

68
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,720
helicopter going to say isn't that your

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,720
job Mr it is it is it is sorry I had to

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,840
get rid of the shell I can't see him

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,480
through

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,280
smoke you mean the smoke of that down

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,879
plane I got a hit this thing's insane oh

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,879
sorry is my plane body causing an issue

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,200
I got a hit on him backing up this thing

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,799
is absolutely bananas the capabilities

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,879
of it helicopter's down it's really good

78
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,120
taking out mgs's ifes and tanks if you

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,840
get on their side the main problem I

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,480
think that happened to it besides the

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,000
changes they made to it in terms of um

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,000
it got more modules right they adjusted

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,239
the armor and the model they increased

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,360
the size of the ammunition to a more

85
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,120
realistic so there's just much more

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,080
stuff in it instead of it just being

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
empty space now other countries that

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,480
sping got a lot better the Germans have

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,280
premium leopard twos now the there's a

90
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,840
Swedish you know premium Leopard 2 out

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,519
there the Christian 2 and then there is

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,239
the um Boxer that was just add in the

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,280
event and that makes the 2s 38 life a

94
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,239
lot harder if you want the 2s 38 we

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,599
recommend getting it after you get a t72

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,920
AV terms or a tud or just unlocking

97
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,200
other Russian tin three things and then

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,879
adding this as a second or third or

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,040
fourth spawn to that lineup yeah it it's

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,959
not really first spawn material but it's

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,439
a very strong addition to any line line

102
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,599
up that you have in that BR

103
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:10,079
range 103 is very good because for for

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:13,920
the Soviets because they have a nearly

105
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:17,280
complete lineup to be made

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:25,360
there they have the Su

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:28,360
25k um and the t72 AV and the T8

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,080
UD which basically gives you all you'd

109
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,639
need but last thing I'll say say is

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
we're not going to do a premium buying

111
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,880
guide this year I don't feel like enough

112
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,160
things have changed from last year's

113
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,840
guide to Warrant a new one what we're

114
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,600

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,080
worth picking up if you're going to buy

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
anything in the sell well I actually put

131
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,759
in a request that we get more Bandon

132
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
Factory yeah that sounds like something

133
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,880
you would do B Factory is a place where

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,199
your heart goes and just

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,360
blossoms yeah it's where our dreams go

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,880
to die you craft things with your hands

137
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,880
that you can export to other nations

138
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,120
called

139
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,759
tanks no it makes

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
A's well the A's go on the tanks but

143
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,360
it's not specifically for tanks it's all

144
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,479
A's all of them that's a lot of pressure

145
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,039
yeah how do you think the ABS gets it it

146
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,880

just like they do tungsten this is a

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,800
huge huge conspiracy you're unraveling

151
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,639

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,039
a factory it is not as kind and happy as

158
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
I thought it

159
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,840

the other side of the wall at a

166
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,520
different

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
tank yeah I regret saying all those nice

168
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,759

for him to push across there I have a

182

he's still

209
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,919
scouted he's looking that way now

210
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,120
there we go pressure's being put on

211
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,440

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,839
parts thank you team is that how you

215
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,320
describe when you're T underneath Parts

216
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,959
the L hold taking the underneath Parts

217
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,480
imagine if we get you hired on though at

218
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,680
the a factory stick all the benefits and

219
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,680
memories you can make

220
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,320
here

221
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,440
blown are you saying that these

222
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
buildings aren't good enough for you

223
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,760
well no I'm just saying that if I get

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
hired here it means they're trying to

225
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,240
reopen this plant which means I have to

226
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,120
rebuild these buildings oh somebody else

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,360
does

228
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,160
that yes but I would be in charge of the

229
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,640
networking

230
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,200
thms you think this place has

231
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,399
networking not yet it's suit can and

232
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,959
string yeah close lines it's actually

233
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,440
just one man yelling really loud from

234
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,800
one building to another yeah but who you

235
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,120
going keep that man's like throat filled

236
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
with water so he can keep yelling stms

237
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,920
that's a weird thing to say I was going

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
to say like keep the batteries and the

239
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,000
bullhorn but I didn't expect you to baby

240
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,000
bird another human being

241
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,360
didn't oh you're a bottle of water that

242
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,240
makes more sense I can understand why

243
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,279
you're hesitant to take the job did you

244
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,959
not know that that's one of the uh key

245
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,480
adaptations that the syrians did to that

246
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:02,440
model thms I am not amphibious I know

247
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,600
that for a fact no I not this will be

248
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,040
fun I am not

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,320
amphibious join us you cannot trick me

250
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,399
into believing this thing is amphibious

251
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,640
oh can we actually fit under that bridge

252
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't think this through if I could

253
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,399
be honest that's pretty

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,240
low yeah it it's really really low do

255
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,600
you want to turn back or oh Target down

256
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,920
the

257
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,000
road I'm glad our team has

258
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:32,120
it GL we have our amp72 here with us

259
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,279
don't I'm thms I'm trying to keep you

260
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,800
alive do you have your floaties on I did

261
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,320
not keep you alive also he did not have

262
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,760
his floaties on otherwise he would have

263
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,000
survived that if you're down here with

264
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,360
us you would have

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,800
lived I would have sunk no you float

266
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,079
those blocks on top of you they're not

267
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,079
ra they're

268
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,079
floaties

269
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,720
they're terms yeah this is a problem

270
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,040
isn't it okay so how's that bridge this

271
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,000
is my bad

272
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,399
a little awkward it's just a little bit

273
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,320
just uh just a

274
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,560
little I at least could do anti-air from

275
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,839
here yeah I don't know what you're going

276
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,160
to do be sad

277
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,720
mostly thms if you come back where you

278
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,880
jumped in do you have enough horsepower

279
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,600
to get out or would you need a

280
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,800
pull it's just kind of a sad thing to

281
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,079
turn around something is amphibious

282
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,399
we're not very fast I just have my

283
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,800
little splash

284
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,040
card yeah I have a splash card to it's

285
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,880
not quite as fancy as yours I hope the

286
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,040
viewers are enjoying this quality 2s3

287
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,920
gameplay they're experiencing right now

288
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,120
yeah I mean this is pretty much I have a

289
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,079
feeling we're going to get up to the top

290
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440
of this and die we just won the true

291
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,519
experience of the military where we got

292
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,399
lost and then had the double back to

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,279
find the correct way to get to the fight

294
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,920
yep don't worry we'll be participating

295
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,079
soon no you won't I got the horizontal

296
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,600
tet drive on the Chinese MBT at the end

297
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:01,959
of the road I'm pushing up right now

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,360
temp to get

299
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,720
shot on

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,600
him he behind the burning corpse yeah

301
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,959
it's hard for me to see sorry yeah yeah

302
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,600
super limited

303
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,760
angles Dr back there though do you like

304
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399

the

306
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,399
river that's

307
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,480
fair you are so quick in that thing with

308
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,760
another 2

gunner I'm going to go to left for

314
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,360
cover why would you

315
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,040

pushing up again so hopefully he can

322
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,079
take that out

323
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,800
Guys across the river firing at the

324
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,120
enemies too

325
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,000
yep all right let's push up all right

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,600
there's a BM right

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
there or debris

328
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,040
pile I am not watch you guys they

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,440
modified these Bridges didn't they these

330
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,519
are these all feel than they used to be

331
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,480
okay but serm did they get much lower or

332
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,320
did the

333
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,880
water I'm sorry try to J I should

334
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,040
looking for

335
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,560
I didn't make it I was going to dive in

336
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,880
the river and leave

337
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,519
you I think the game uh frowned upon

338
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,839
that I was about to say like how unfun

339
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,399
is it to lower all the bridges where we

340
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,720
can't float down the river I know right

341
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,839
who made that

342
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,720
decision are we the same guy that blew

343
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,000
all the bridges for low tier I'm now

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,920
just going to go to random Eastern

345
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,560
European towns and measure Bridges oh to

346
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,920
see if this is the correct historically

347
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,160
accurate height I'm going to find the

348
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,560
average height of a bridge in Eastern

349
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,199
Europe and divide and we'll figure out

350
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,399
what it should be okay

351
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,560
okay but would wouldn't we also have to

352
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,959
account for the average water levels uh

353
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,800
year over-ear true it's going to get

354
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,440
complicated did raise a good point there

355
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,360
that it could be that the water level is

356
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,160
also raising I was about to say what if

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,480
it's flood

358
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,519
season I am flooding in pain did you

359
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,920
hear that besides the one that killed

360
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:30,639
him oh no I just turned his uh life get

361
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,440
snuffed out before my eyes yeah I killed

362
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,600
something

363
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,279
hey time

364
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,600

you let's this get

416
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,240
Rowdy I could not get in time the thing

417
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,560
behind me was also chasing me yeah I

418
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,120
just saw that guy starting to peek

419
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,040
around the corner so I appreciate it was

420
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,079
kind of boxed in there every time

421
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,639
tonight when you've asked me where do

422
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,440
you want to go yes I've done nothing but

423
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,680
get a

424
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,319
killed yeah I don't imagine that I'll do

425
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,039
much better but I feel like that

426
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,000
responsibility should be taking off my

427
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,679
shoulders just so that stick boy has a

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,640
chance to

429
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,280
survive oh that's sweet of you to think

430
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,039
that he had that chance look he's the

431
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,360
best of us we have to let the future

432
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,919
Prosper he's basically the sea turtle

433
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,120
hatchling of our

434
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,240
group don't say that as he's the last

435
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,720
tank I spawn I'm sorry second to last

436
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,840
there's still I'm just a laid ahe

437
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,559
sure he's the one to get smashed by a

438
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,600
tourist stepping on him yeah either that

439
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,600
or the seagulls will get

440
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,440
him it it shot past you to take me that

441
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,880
little tree that you're hiding behind

442
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,080
has completely camouflaged

443
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,679
you I have the worst luck tonight then

444
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,520
again I did paint my tank kind of like

445
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,480
neon green like a circuit board Mosaic I

446
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,360
think is the fancy word that artists

447
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,320
call

448
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,960
it that's actually what it's called I

449
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,559
think it's a digital Mosaic or something

450
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,880
digital Mosaic experimental Mosaic

451
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,520
that's fancy the the tree did not help

452
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,640
by the way no I got killed

453
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,720
immediately that tree gave you more life

454
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,280
than it gave

455
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,080
me well that's probably because I was

456
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,320
more camouflaged than you I actually

457
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,840
thought about diving into the uh water

458
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,240
there to escape what was going to happen

459
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,960
to me and I said no I will stay with

460
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,440
sterms I'll be a good teammate and not

461
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,440
abandoned him that was a mistake yeah

462
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,159
hiss now stick boy's out there by

463
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,520
himself trying to take the a point

464
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,880
without his sad mates yeah he's actually

465
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,960
doing a pretty good job he's last a lot

466
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,120
longer than the rest of us how much

467
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,720
longer you live on that

468
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,919
corner I mean how how many times are you

469
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,880
going to keep mentioning that I'm alive

470
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,480
on the corner you pushed that right

471
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,360
flank pretty good by

472
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,080
yourself feel to be alive right now uh I

473
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,679
mean it's fine I'm a little hurt a

474
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
little banged up but you know we keep

475
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,799
running we're going to know you alive

476
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,919
we're we're we're really going to hit

477
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:09,320
them hard on the second half you know um

478
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,960
if he lives longer than I do

479
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,960
again I'll be really upset I'm actually

480
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,000
diving into the water to hide even more

481
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,559
but I don't think there's a way up from

482
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,919
the water is the problem there isn't I'm

483
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,000
happy down here this is my life now good

484
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,880
job on the kill we're going to see a

485
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,159
little little a couple of lineup changes

486
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,480
you

487
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,120
know yep yep he's killing we take we

488
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,760
take the hits on the chin we build we

489
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,679
improve imagine the Vikings play like

490
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,240
that on Sunday oh they'd be undefeated

491
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,679
still way to beat a man down when he's

492
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,440
riding High got to keep him honest you

493
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,440
know got to keep him

494
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,120
humble so Bo if you regreted your

495
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,840
decision

496
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,240
yeah well if you can hold it long enough

497
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,720
there is a su2 and a little bird inbound

498
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,640
to your

499
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,640
location can we get some more ground for

500
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,120
no ground ground force is dominated by

501
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,280
wield destroyers right now can we hire

502
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,600
some

503
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,799
mercenaries uh what do you think you are

504
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,200
right now not a very good mercenary well

505
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,400
that's because you're a pirate not a

506
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
mercenary so not even a pirate this is

507
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,679
more like gilan's Island Russian Edition

508
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,799
happening over

509
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,080
here I don't know they showed some modum

510
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,080
of Competency on gillig Good's Island I

511
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,240
feel bad about our su2 he is his best

512
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,240
now but

513
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,360
there's that just fire from that corner

514
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,360
at

515
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,760
him there's something over there but

516
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,559
they won push the corner could have shot

517
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,240
I can't see him but I just saw the

518
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,240
missile come from that

519
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,000
corner you see how many marks were in

520
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,480
our spawn yes I feel bad about being

521
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,559
stuck down there but also I don't after

522
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I

523
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,760
saw the circle of red

524
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,880
engulfing

525
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,919
spawn the massive

526
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,320
encirclement I think that Abrams is the

527
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,080
most aggressive real estate agent I've

528
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,240
ever seen is he selling real estate

529
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,720
right selling 120s to people's faces

530
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
right now over there I'm actually kind

531
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,760
of an

532
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,320
awe okay well I'm going to push to the

533
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,039
right and get away from

534
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,480
that horrific thing I'm

535
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,360
watching he's doing his job we can

536
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,400
support him though if we uh flank out oh

537
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,440
okay

538
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,000
support your local business support your

539
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,320
local Abrams make sure that they get the

540
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,200
resources they desire from the local

541
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,640

assistant to the

554
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
manager I also think there's a tank to

555
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,559
the front left that's why I've not been

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,919
pushing see where that Mark

557
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,000
was I mean I see the mark on the

558
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,559
map if you do a really good job we can

559
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,520
find you a house to buy around here I'm

560
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:31,440
sure they're uh in his budget prices are

561
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,600
fair reduced even is worble

562
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,240
use that was from your close left no

563
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,640
yeah close right it just kept pushing

564
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
along CL

565
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,880
right yeah okay looking at your mark I

566
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,080
don't see him you good up there I think

567
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,279
he might have just got taken down by a

568
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,279
teammate I don't know for sure though

569
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,559
yeah got hits on the r right in front of

570
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,799
you oh that's one right there close I'm

571
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,200

00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,279
out to your left I prair you right now

573
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,760
but I figure it's best for me to defend

574
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,840
you from back here no that's probably a

575
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,240
good idea it's only 20 seconds it should

576
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,360
be fine I'm going to push up and repair

577
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,480

578
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,000

579
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240

580
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,120

I'm

586
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,880
dead I feel like it's punishment to get

587
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,880
in the t72 after my 2s3 was taken out

588
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,200
immediately cresting hill by a spike

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
missile I'm been shot

590
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,960

591
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,960

596
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,080

602
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,360

603
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,400

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,600
got mistreated by a spike missile and

605
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,880

606
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:20,840
