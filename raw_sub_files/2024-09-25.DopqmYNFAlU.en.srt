1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
what does the a factory make people

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,439
asbestos I was going to say aspirations

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,559
but I guess that works too well why

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,920
would they make aspirations in a

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:14,839
factory because the Soviet people are

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,320
counting on the factory no they have to

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,680
learn to live without those kind of

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,519
things aestus will keep them warm we

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,000
we'll we'll save meso for another time

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,519
you heard that History Channel ad so

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,359
many times as a child well you

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:34,760
have burn ads

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,120
that like random disease is I swear the

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,559
most televised disease

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,840
ever I can close my eyes and see the

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,239
text crawl next to

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,760
lupus wait you had lupus

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,000
ads no he saw it in house no my family

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,760
kept watching house on repeat that makes

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,960
more sense and they talk about lupus

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,719
like every other episode and how it

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,320
isn't lupus I swear it was every episode

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,320
to be honest terms

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,680
so the a factory doesn't make people

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,840
happy and hopeful no there are very few

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,040
factories that I think actually have the

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
byproduct of making people happy what

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,119
about the Lego factory that's not true

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
stms the Lego factory the McDonald's

30
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,439
chicken nugget Factory nobody's happy at

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,880
the McDonald's chicken nugget

32
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,280
Factory imagine Happy

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560

anything to be stuck behind this either

321
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:32,800
the t92 was last seen there

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
all laughed at me when I said I want

367
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,920
anyway uh but if you're a ghost you can

368
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,839
charge people to like scare bad renters

369
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,720
out and

370
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,040
stuff all right there's a couple things

371
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,160
over here that one's very dangerous I

372
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,680
can't get the pt6 off the point he's

373
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,199
down okay good so now it's uh equal caps

374
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,199
here I'm very close to

375
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
a as I said that I knew I was about to

376
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,880
lose

377
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,880
it no no you got this you still got this

378
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,560
you got this I'm

379
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,920
reping uh I I don't really trust leaving

380
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,399
a

381
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,519
I would either I'll try to get Bravo but

382
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,079
there is a ban right here just waiting

383
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
to rip my face off gotcha gotcha I'm

384
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,399
also very close to a nuke so if we can

385
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,959
hold two cap points I can probably drop

386
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:16,839
it okay our pbv uh or I mean our friend

387
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,279
on B just got killed

388
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,959
copy I don't believe that the enemy is

389
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,680
on the point yet over here another one

390
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,399
came

391
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,399
in affirmative this end of me I'm

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,199
sorry maybe I get enough negative angle

393
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,600
here I can disappear

394
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,040
okay uh they hurting me immensely

395
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,079
so our teammate back there or you might

396
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,199
have to do this okay it just rolled on

397
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,480
to B I'm going to try and drive across I

398
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,240
have a very big repair and two Targets

399
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,160
over here I'm also being Saed think he

400
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,079
just charged me straight up he's on my

401
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,959
body that's so far from

402
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,800
me there's one

403
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,160
serms got that one

404
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,480
still out there though nice job

405
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,559
canceling that cap that just saved it

406
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,439
for

407
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,360
now good job over there3 down died don't

408
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,079
die to Bard now

409
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,839
yep I am rushing back in AA with a lot

410
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,720
of

411
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,640
ammo and I have Google's friend good

412
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,199
good I'm glad you have friends um as

413
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,679
soon as B's taken I'm going to try and

414
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,640
get back across to a because that is

415
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,720
probably where they're going to push

416
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,320
next

417
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,760
if we get on Charlie that'd be our best

418
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,120
bet too but that's a long it's just so

419
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,160
far away

420
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,440
yeah we don't really have the tickets to

421
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,679
spare right now correct I mean if we

422
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,600
lose two people two deaths is

423
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:50,000
enough I'm driving a giant

424
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,360
bomb we just lost one guy to the left

425
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,520
yeah to another bang

426
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,679
Cannon we just lost two teammates right

427
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,480
there at the end

428
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,960
yeah I mean that's the risk of low of

429
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,200
letting the tickets Get Low like that I

430
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
mean they did a good job pushing both

431
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,840
caps the entire time so it wasn't like

432
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,400
we could just easily run onto either one

433
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,840
of them no no and then me getting stuck

434
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,720
behind t95 for a good amount of time

435
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,280
probably wasn't also super

436
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,440
helpful no no but there wasn't a lot you

437
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,440
could do about

438
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,440
that don't get kidnapped by t95

439
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,320
kids yeah it's not

440
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,039
recommended I feel like stick took off

441
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,720
to do his laundry or

442
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,799
something oh no he might be broken down

443
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,559
in like Purgatory or something

444
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,520
Purgatory yeah it's a he goes there a

445
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:42,600
lot I think his computer actually just

446
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,919
crashed oh great uh do you see yeah so

447
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,840
we need to somehow plane coming

448
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,200
in those are bombs don't worry it's

449
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,600
bombing somebody else ax50 no it's

450
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,919
gone there's only so much we can do I'm

451
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,480
going to push up and protect stick if

452
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,720
got Le one never mind I'll leer one's

453
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
good though

454
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't think anybody's good the

455
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,840
Centurion is behind one of the buildings

456
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,799
just tucked in in the shadows I'm still

457
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,320
reloading s is getting shot I have to

458
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,000
try to save him you don't have to no I

459
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,120
have to I mean he's effectively bright

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,360
his tank is now brain dead there is no

461
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,159
one

462
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,640
home I can still defend and there will

463
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,799
never be anyone home I don't know what

464
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
to do for him let him die use him as a

465
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,080
shield I took a shot for him lost my

466
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,559
Barrel

467
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,280
parking him I died so he could live

468
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,120
longer

469
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,240
okay Bo I just need you to understand

470
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,240
that I would never do that for you I

471
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,559
felt bad for trying to push up and take

472
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,520
shots and find the thing earlier for you

473
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,000
but I at least one to try to be a good

474
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,600
team was alive I understand I was just

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,880
trying to do the nice thing okay he's

476
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,440
still alive down there there's still

477
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,520
hope no no there is don't give out F

478
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
Stick

479
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,200
Boy heam May fix this computer

480
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,720
yes he might get it online get

481
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,080
everything back up and then manage to

482
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,480
rejoin the match before he dies you know

483
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,679
he's making a snack right

484
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,520
now I mean he is probably using the

485
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,240
opportunity for it to boot back up to do

486
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,080
that you see that Mark to close to him

487
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,760
two Targets yes multiple actually one's

488
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,919
down they are dying I mean there is a

489
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,919
chance that he survives the match it's

490
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,280
slim but uh operation protects stick

491
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,960
boys a go

492
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,520
I mean that's your operation that's my

493
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,880
operation okay okay I need a purpose

494
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,880
that's my

495
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,360
purpose cuz that's my purpose right now

496
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,520
tun on airplanes going to

497
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,919
try something's marked in between those

498
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,320
buildings but I can't quite see it

499
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,679
yet okay over

500
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:59,159
there but also something Mark closer to

501
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,520
stick tank destroyer looks of it

502
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,400
yeah there's also a light tank

503
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,960
approaching his position pretty quickly

504
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,960
XM 800t I'm trying to get

505
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,840
there there's I3 kind of we're watching

506
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,400
him I was hoping he um all right he's

507
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,320
launched Warth Hunter so there's a sign

508
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,840
of

509
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,960
life I'm totally not spying on him oh

510
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,320
wow he's connected Hello Stick hello you

511
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,039
are still alive can you get into the

512
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,799
game quickly how am I still alive

513
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,120
Bo decided to sacrifice his life for

514
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:37,120
your brainless tank other tanks are down

515
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,240
here protecting

516
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,559
you why now when you come back please

517
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,360
don't complain that you've driven into a

518
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,360
house the house has kept you

519
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
alive here I'm I'm moving you in fully

520
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
now mostly because the enemy team

521
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,520
believes that you are dead how many

522
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,880
people have sacrificed themselves saving

523
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,039
me uh don't ask you really don't want

524
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,039
that answer

525
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,279
but you're Al why have people sacrificed

526
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,919
to save me cuz in a war you need a cause

527
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,039
also you're quite jiggly maybe that's

528
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,880
why oh my God and your tank likes to oh

529
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,320
should probably Focus On Target on

530
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Range st's one right

531
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:25,480
