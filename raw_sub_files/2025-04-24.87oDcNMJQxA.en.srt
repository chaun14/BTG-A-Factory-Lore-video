1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Storms, I hope you realize you're just

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,799
playing with two toddlers that have no

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,840
plan or idea on what to do. I picked up

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,639
on that pretty early in the video.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,639
Prepare for the toddler swarm.

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,199
I took gunners. I took gunners. There's

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,320
three. Something else shot

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,920
me. That was through you and to me,

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
though. Just run. Just run. Just run.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,880
Just run.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,279
One's

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,279
down. I'm sorry. Escape. You got the

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
cheese. And run.

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm actually going to flank around. Take

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,040
them from the six if I can.

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,559
Oh, there's more. Can you mark them for

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
me before you die? Oh, yeah. One right

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,360
there. Marking. Marking. Marking. Oh,

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,960
no, no, no, no. That's a bad BTR80 came

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,719
to cut me off from the direction. Time

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
for a little War Thunder real talk. And

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
these are my opinions and my feelings,

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,320
and you can judge me accordingly. Okay.

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
I don't like people who play the

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,120
XM0000t, but I like playing the XM00.

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,280
Does that make me a hypocrite? Yes. Do I

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
feel sweaty and dirty when I play the XM

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
T? Yes. Mhm. But there are like swarms

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,880
of these things that just come through

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,600
and disembow villages and it is

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
piranhas. But we're part of the problem.

32
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,119
So here we are. You're part of the

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,920
problem. Secondly, it's going up from 80

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
to 83 in the proposed changes. Yes. And

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
I kind of was like, well, that doesn't

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,759
do a lot because I run at 83 anyways

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
with my lineup normally and um I have no

38
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,920
issues. But then it occurred to me if

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,560
you really want to punish the

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,720
XMT, drop it down to like 77 or 70 and

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,200
let it face World War II heavies or

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,119
IS-6s, IS-3s,

43
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,479
IS-4s heavy armor. Yeah, that's how it

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,240
needs to be nerfed. It needs to go down,

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,240
not up. That's my hot take right now.

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
I mean, that is a big brain play right

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
there. Also, don't judge me for the

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,759
things I'm about to do. If you want, we

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
can go at the same time. That way, he

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,320
has to pick who to shoot. Uh, there's

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
one out there. Sorry. Moving to the

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,399
left. I should tell you about that. I

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,159
have a lot of rocks in my way, so I'm

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
pretty safe. I'm kind of worried about

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,600
the close one. He's flanking around the

56
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
village.

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
Flanking around whose village? Sorry,

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,239
let me mark a map. Something is sitting

59
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,360
out like here.

60
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,200
Okay, probably closer by

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,720
now. Uh, stick push. A shot. Go. That

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,080
was a D 105, by the way.

63
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
Just working on your tank recognition.

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm not judging. Yeah. In his defense,

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
that's an oscillating turret. It was I'm

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,480
just I just saw the turret and went

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,920
French. I know it wasn't a bad guess.

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,920
You were partially correct there. Kind

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
of.

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,319
Should be one to your front left. He's

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
thematically correct. I got this one on

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,200
the right. Look your left. I'll get the

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,760
one on the right with both. We're

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,120
getting two different things. No.

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
No, we were. There was one to your left,

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,840
by the way.

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
Look what I can do. Oh, wow. He actually

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm actually coming back to repair you.

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I just

80
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:04,159
Oh, I won't be coming back to repair

81
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,159
you. Ice terms were both

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,480
broken. That does not help. Also, please

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,560
don't melt the ice. I'm standing on.

84
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, you'll be fine. You see how far our

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,440
two teammates ran past A? Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,760
That's what happens when you have comps

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
and

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,959
XM800Ts. I'm not going to lie, Bo, I

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
really thought you had launched off the

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,239
right of that jump and was about to go

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,239
into the water. Wait, we're just going

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,239
to let his remarks go unchallenged.

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,159
Okay, fair enough. I I don't have a a

94
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,920
challenge to it.

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,400
We need to make a solid rebuttal here

96
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,560
when we have it. No, no, no, no, no. Bo,

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,799
you No, please. Somebody, somebody

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
please. I'm fine. It's too late for him.

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
No, I'm fine. It's like I can still hear

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,840
his voice sometimes. I've got two

101
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,720
sitting right here. Okay, I'm going to

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,159
see what I can do in terms of One's

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,000
down, other one's down. Hooray.

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,480
I was just going for breaches and t crew

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
first, but no. What is

106
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,200
that? It had eyes and it was staring at

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,159
me like it was a giant frog and it

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
terrified me. Well, at least you killed

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,400
it. You know how it has the two

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,720
launchers that are sitting far out wide?

111
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,040
Yeah, it had giant eyes on each one. It

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,120
scared me. It was just sitting there

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
staring at me. I am not clear further

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
left.

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Oh,

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
I can push that though if you want.

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,400
Guess that works.

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,960
Excellent work. Oh, there it is.

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Front front storms. I'm sorry. I

120
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,320
couldn't do anything about that one.

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,400
I couldn't either. First map of the

122
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,320
night and it's your favorite. Abandoned

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:54,000
factory. A single cap. A factory.

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,520
It's the best, right?

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,320
I have the happiest little factory

126
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,400
worker, too. The little gremlin with

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
small hands that can make anything.

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,960
There's There's really only one thing

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
that's recovering this night for me.

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,240
What's that? You'll find out in just a

131
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,280
second. I'm going to guess CSU.

132
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,400
57 and it's a flamethrower. You're going

133
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,039
to light me on fire. That's what's going

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,120
to happen. Yes.

135
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,199
Go ahead. Get out of your system. There

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,960
we go. Bathing in the Why is everybody

137
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,280
shooting at me? The entire team is

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,759
shooting at me.

139
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Why? Wait, now you're getting bullied.

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:36,880
No, that that it's a tight fit.

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
Everybody tried to go at once. Yeah,

142
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to outrun all of you.

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Actually, no. stick to some Xer. It is

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,759
an absolute mess back here. Just keep

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,120
going, Bo. Look at what we're in. Look

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,880
at Storm saying you have fire. That's

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,360
amazing.

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,360
That thing reaches so far. It does.

149
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,639
I'm going to push pretty aggressive and

150
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,000
try to cut them off. Okay.

151
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm going to go all the way through this

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
building and see if I can stop them at

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,199
that fence if they're not there already.

154
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
Watch. If you can pull them off, the

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,240
rest of us should get there shortly.

156
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah, I'm pushing straight through

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,440
there. Where's that one at?

158
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,880
Is not want to be seen by that.

159
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,680
Gone. It was down by uh where the B

160
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,479
point usually is. Uh BMP just roll past

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,319
me. Okay, I am holding the cap

162
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,319
though. Scouted.

163
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,520
Okay, I'm rolling forward. I'm going to

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
see if I can swing around. He is

165
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,880
That's not worth the risk. He's coming

166
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,240
back my way. He's

167
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,319
tracked. I'll see I get more of him.

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,600
Never mind. Nice job, Storms. One went

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,639
across over there to the left.

170
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,680
Affirmative. I don't have a great angle

171
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
on that. No, I just watched that corner.

172
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
Yep.

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll see if I can watch for you. He's

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
marked over there now. Yeah, I should be

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,919
able to fire over the BMP's corpse. He's

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,160
terms. Yes. Hi there. Hi. What are you

177
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,400
doing? Oh, I'm just watching this

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
corner. You want to be neighbors? Not

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,800
really. Oh, that's hurtful. Okay. I'm

180
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,520
sad. Well, I mean, what am I? I I'm in a

181
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,360
field. Like an empty space. Can't live

182
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,039
in that.

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,199
You're like a tank that grazes.

184
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,400
A T5 would make a great Just call me a

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,639
tank.

186
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,440
Yeah. Now we know we really feel

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,919
disturbed. Let's get a move on.

188
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,680
No, I'll try that again

189
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,880
later. Oh, he died. The joke was that

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,360
bad. You died. Yes, it the joke is what

191
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,800
killed me. Not the AMX30 behind that

192
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
smaller building. No, it wasn't a French

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,840
tank. No, it definitely wasn't. I just

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,360
just exploded. I love this watching me

195
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,360
like the guy just drove off

196
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,639
caring. I got him scouted up. I'm hoping

197
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,599
teammate pushes.

198
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,080
We got people up there.

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,599
Yes.

200
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
Should I now just run around like a

201
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
gremlin? I mean, isn't that what you're

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
already doing? No, I'm playing

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,599
tactically kind of.

204
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,000
Wow. Tactically kind of. It's a real

205
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,759
thing.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,639
Well, there's Oh, never mind. You see

207
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,560
them on your left? Yep. Working on them.

208
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,160
Feel free to do anything you want. Okay.

209
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,160
Yep. A real thing. Don't worry. Scouted.

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,760
I saw you on fire. He's wounded. He's

211
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,159
under crew, too.

212
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,320
Uh, reach is out.

213
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,360
I hear helicopter. I'm going to look for

214
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,279
that. Don't worry. He's um he's not dead

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
or shot down, but No, I hear it to my

216
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,040
left though. No, he's down. He's down.

217
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
He's down.

218
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,640
Is it just the one?

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,640
Yes, I believe so.

220
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,519
I'm going to push back around. Dragonfly

221
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,399
looking ones.

222
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,399
Oh, look at that big guy.

223
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
All right, back towards you. Driving up

224
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
on

225
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
He's just driving up on everything. I

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,680
told you. Gremlin mode. Okay. Well, I

227
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
hope he doesn't need assistance because

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,720
we're all I just reverse past and the

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,720
other guy's following me, too.

230
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,959
Two targets moving there. Scouted.

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,240
trying to be helpful.

232
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,320
I can take one easily. I can't. I don't

233
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,560
have enough pressure.

234
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,120
That'll come later.

235
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,720
Oh, I'm keenly

236
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,640
aware. There's also one to the left

237
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,920
apparently. I'll jump that one. Sorry,

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,360
that was your right. No, no, no. He's to

239
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,480
your right. Hard right. Hard right. I

240
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,080
see him.

241
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,160
Okay. I thought I saw a tracer coming

242
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,920
from the left up at the aactory.

243
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:03,959
Uh, stick. Uh-huh. If you have Oh,

244
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,959
something's trying to teach you at me.

245
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,160
Do you need help? Uh, and no, it's

246
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
fineish.

247
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,279
Okay, cuz I got I got the one on your

248
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,640
left. Yeah, it's not

249
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,519
fine. It's amazing how quickly it

250
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,680
converts to not fine. Hey, Storm's to

251
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,360
our right. There's two of them moving.

252
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,640
Okay, I'm going to try and keep an eye.

253
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,160
Yeah, let's just move into the low

254
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
ground. I was going to say if you want

255
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
to finish your guy, I'll just push those

256
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,760
ones down already.

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,320
I don't have tracks anymore. Okay, turn

258
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,399
around to help you. I'm sorry. I guess

259
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
I'm going to turn back and watch the uh

260
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,600
situ. Never mind. I'm going to get autoc

261
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:45,760
cannon by Gapard.

262
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,000
I traded with him at least. Hooray.

263
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,399
Small

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,839
victories. Oh, dear God. What'd you

265
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
find? I came around the corner and ran

266
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
to a leopard one.

267
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
That's a scary round the corner target.

268
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,399
That's the guy.

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,240
You just lost a leopard one. Yeah, we do

270
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,600
that sometimes.

271
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Uh there's something else back here near

272
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,360
us. Okay, I'm pushing back into the

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,279
town. In between sick and I in between

274
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
us.

275
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Found him. Oh, good work. Hooray.

276
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,760
Hi. There's going to be one behind you

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,800
in a second. Oh, okay.

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,480
I'm just running off a plan. Sorry. I

279
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,200
mean, isn't that how you know normal XM8

280
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,200
things is you just run around uh never

281
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,120
take the mode throttle and shoot as you

282
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,040
go? Hold down W occasionally. Left click

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
and try not to keep up with you guys. I

284
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
don't know where you're going and I

285
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,040
can't keep track of you on the map.

286
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,200
We're just circling you Sterms. That's

287
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,760
it.

288
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,839
Sir, look to your left here and say a a

289
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,399
I took his gunner in his right track.

290
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,320
Wow. Also, something direct front of me.

291
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm looking. I'm pushing. I'm sorry.

292
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,959
It's machine guning me. Don't know what

293
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,240
it is. It is a ZTZ 59D1.

294
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,399
I was trying to buy you time there. I'm

295
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,279
sorry. No, no, it's it's good. He got

296
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,959
blown up by somebody.

297
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,040
The enemy just doesn't seem interested

298
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,120
in me. I've noticed yet they just

299
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
completely ignored that. Literally, he

300
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:23,680
had the chance to fire at Bow and take

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:27,279
him out and just shot over him.

302
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,600
Oh, I'm undesirable.

303
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,720
Wow. Storms, you died again. I am sorry.

304
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm so They are to the north of our

305
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,560
spawn firing in. Head that direction. I

306
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,639
see on the map.

307
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm sorry. I feel bad for you. I don't

308
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,240
feel too bad.

309
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,360
Oh, wait. No, no, no. The other one is

310
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,360
like way up there. It's a TAM. I was

311
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
going to repair this guy. Ignore him.

312
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
He's dead. He's got a face. I see the

313
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,200
TAM. I see the TAM. He's not dead. He

314
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,440
just looks mangled. It's too late for

315
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,160
him. I'm literally repairing him right

316
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,600
now. Tam has no cannon barrel. If I held

317
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,600
down the button long enough to repair

318
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,880
him. Plane friendly. Okay, thank

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,880
goodness.

320
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,910
How's that one still alive back there?

321
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,000
He's behind a corpse. Got him. Hooray.

322
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,519
[Music]

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't repair the friendly thing there,

324
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,079
but I can make that shot.

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
We did it, guys. I shouldn't be that

326
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,959
impressed because I fired like 30 shots

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,720
with one click. So, okay. Now, now what

328
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,160
do we Now, now what do we do?

329
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,760
You didn't think this far ahead? I

330
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,320
didn't.

331
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,600
What if we just

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,639
like I don't know. I mean, we could go

333
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,240
to the cafe. It says they're still open.

334
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
Where's the cafe? There's no cats at

335
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
this cafe.

336
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, that's because this is America in

337
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,360
like the early 60s. Yeah, but look how

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,040
much they like have a sale. Yeah. Why

339
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,600
are we going to a cafe that has 50% off

340
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,079
anything? That's not good. Well, no. 50%

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,680
off 20% sale 30% off sale 20%. And

342
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,199
sandwich

343
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,240
my whole plan here is going to come down

344
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,160
to surprise and hopefully no heavy tanks

345
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
being outside this ridge. I don't feel

346
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
so good about that second half. There's

347
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,920
going to be something hard left. Yeah,

348
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,560
they've already passed us. I'm pushing

349
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,480
through. Martyr taking in first. Yep.

350
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm looking left. Got the one left.

351
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,720
There's two. There's one more. There you

352
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,120
go. Nice

353
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,959
job. I think we just run at this point.

354
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah, run. Cut bait and run. Yeah, I

355
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,160
lost my breach. There's something in

356
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,399
front of you. Shot in front of you, Bo.

357
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,320
Got him. Farf, never mind. We're good.

358
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,399
Well, I guess Well, you're just going.

359
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm going to see. Bo, there's one left.

360
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,120
Just You need to keep moving. There's

361
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,760
one sitting right here.

362
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,560
Okay, hold on. I'll turn around.

363
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,560
He's not pushing though.

364
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,240
Do you see him there? No, I do not. I

365
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
think I shot a rock thinking it was him.

366
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
Okay, I'm going to hold here for a

367
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,639
second.

368
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,120
Died over there. Nice job. Yeah, I heard

369
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,000
him back there. Swing fire. I'm going to

370
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
move back towards Surms and help him.

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,880
I'll get just a second. Don't worry

372
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,880
about me. All right, I'm just going to

373
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,560
see pushing over this hill.

374
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm just trying to do some uh practice

375
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,720
scouting for you if I can.

376
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,320
Okay, I'm actually going to try and get

377
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,000
down to A. Actually, yeah, something's

378
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,000
on A. I'm going to move that way.

379
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah, something just literally got on to

380
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
A. You've got a Bradley also possibly

381
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,440
helping you. It's looks like a Leopard

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,120
one. I'm right behind you. It's going to

383
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,600
fire at me. Never mind. You good? Nice

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,480
job. Yeah. Would you like us to capture

385
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,839
it? Yes. Oh, so we get max

386
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,120
air. It's like a tandem dive right

387
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,279
there. Those Oh,

388
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,680
we collide.

389
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,759
So, competent teammates, we aren't not

390
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,120
that thing.

391
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Bo, I think

392
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,000
we're doing a pretty good job at what we

393
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,800
plan to do

394
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,959
so far. Yes, actually. Do you see it,

395
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,480
Storms?

396
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,480
Nope. Wait, there's a bomb under me.

397
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,680
Oh, my turret popped off, too.

398
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, I don't I didn't get a good look

399
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,839
of mine

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,199
did. I see the mark. I saw something for

401
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,959
a brief second pushing up the hill.

402
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,199
There it

403
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,199
is. Oh my.

404
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Remember the ME262 that bombed us? Yeah.

405
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,480
He now has HVT.

406
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,360
Gotcha. Don't challenge that man. When

407
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,000
they're attacking me in swarms, it's not

408
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,839
my favorite thing. But then when you

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,160
play

410
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,039
it, you have to become what you hate.

411
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,919
Oh, which is a knife wielding grat

412
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,880
gremlin. But I don't feel any remorse

413
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,120
when I'm in the X800T.

414
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,439
Yeah, that's the uh the great mystery.

415
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,600
I'm very conflicted.

416
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
I I don't think so. I feel like I should

417
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,760
have shame, but there's no shame be

418
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
found.

419
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,760
No, the the feeling that you feel when

420
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,400
you're fighting the XM800T is actually

421
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,640
the desire to simply be in the XM800T.

422
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
There's a thing. We lost Dick Boy. Um,

423
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
an 81

424
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
that's in front of me on top of the

425
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
bridge. The bridge. The circle. The

426
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
clover bridge. I love the description

427
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,559
he's giving us. I know what he's talking

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,799
about. I do too. But

429
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,360
anything gunner and breach. You want to

430
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,640
finish him? No.

431
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
Okay. Uh well, you're going to have to

432
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,559
cuz I can't get through the turret.

433
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,280
Okay.

434
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:05,919
Safe. Uh nothing over that way. No. I

435
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,760
can jump him. I can go push him. Okay.

436
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
I'm going to try and push around because

437
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,400
he's probably pushing down by now. Yeah.

438
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm going to hop over here if I can.

439
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,760
Uh Sturms.

440
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,840
Um yeah, don't push that way. Problem.

441
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,360
There's a problem. Large problem. Okay.

442
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,039
It's named Mouse and it's looking for

443
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,280
stick.

444
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,480
Ah,

445
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,000
what? No. Tell him I'm gone.

446
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,919
He only want I don't want to answer that

447
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,200
phone call. He lit just said, "Where's

448
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,760
Stick Boy? I need to talk to him. He owe

449
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,919
me

450
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,240
money." What he said, but in German.

451
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,960
I don't know anybody. I couldn't do a

452
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
proper translation.

453
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,039
Sorry. So, I went with that voice for a

454
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,039
mouse. I don't know what's wrong with

455
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,720
me.

456
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,200
Okay. I just need you to hold all the

457
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
enemies there. I ran away. Your thing is

458
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,840
now shooting at me from the bridge, by

459
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,440
the way. Okay.

460
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,919
Wait, the mouse is on the bridge. No,

461
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,679
he's in that direction, though. Yeah.

462
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,640
No, he's marked on the map. See that

463
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:15,760
heavy tank mark on the map occasionally?

464
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,760
Yeah. about um

465
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,720
there that's

466
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,039
uh there is a class three on top of the

467
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,960
bridge. I can help with that. That is I

468
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,679
think one is slowly taking me part by

469
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
part. Can you mark it or something? Do

470
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,360
you know which bridge it is? There's a

471
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,640
Leopard one underneath the bridge.

472
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm going to be honest, the bridge seems

473
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,400
to be where it's happening. terms. I'm

474
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,799
concerned. I got your uh whatever it

475
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,480
was.

476
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,160
Good call out. Yep. That that wasn't

477
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,400
even what he called. I got a ruicat that

478
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,840
was on a bridge. Probably not his

479
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,000
bridge. Ser, I'm nervous right now. Is

480
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,200
it because of the bridge? Just the

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,799
things that keep popping up from every

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,640
angle.

483
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,679
Oh, I see. No, the mouse is here. I'm

484
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,640
not even kidding. Can you escape? Uh,

485
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm going to try. I can't leave the BMP.

486
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,080
Yes, you can. No, I can't. I left him

487
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,520
earlier. That's not very nice. If I can

488
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,080
tone him down. Oh, I need more weight

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,200
and power. Come on. Come on,

490
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,080
buddy. He's also trying to appear, so

491
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,440
he's not.

492
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,720
Hey, Sterms. Yeah. Who can I call right

493
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,760
now? Push to you. It's fine. There's

494
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,559
something on the bridge.

495
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,760
There's a mouse directly in front of me.

496
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay, I am trying to get to you. Never

497
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,320
mind. The leopard found me. Where was

498
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,520
the leopard, Surms? Actually, really

499
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,480
close to me. It was uh the north bridge

500
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,440
nearest to our spawn. He's hiding in the

501
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,799
shadow of that. Come pay off this mouse.

502
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,720
I I I have I am taking the focus of the

503
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,400
mouse. Never mind. He's back on you. As

504
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
you're saying that, he's swinging his

505
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,559
gun over to kill me as I was trying to

506
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,559
help you.

507
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,840
Ser, this tank just looks completely

508
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,840
lost and just done with life. He was

509
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,400
trying to escape

510
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,320
being chased by a BP1 at X00T. The poor

511
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,760
guy was just like, I'm done with this

512
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,080
game. Get me out of here.

513
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,679
He almost

514
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,080
managed, but no one can escape the light

515
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,000
tanks forever.

516
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,840
My primary goal at this point is to try

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,840
to tame and domesticate enemy tank as a

518
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Locust.

519
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,559
That guy

520
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,120
is other side of the train tracks. He He

521
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,320
if you pull too out of the open bow,

522
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,679
he'll get you.

523
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
Stick. I'd like to highly recommend do

524
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
not push me because there's about five

525
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,600
tanks on my

526
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,919
position. I'm friend. I'm not food. I'm

527
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,880
friend.

528
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,320
Wow. He seemed hungry.

529
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,320
I'm apparently hungry enough to eat his

530
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,320
friend.

531
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:15,530
