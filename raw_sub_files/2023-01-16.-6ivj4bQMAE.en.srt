take three all the other Abrams did a

260
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,140
little drifty thing too oh I should

261
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,760
probably pay attention

262
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:12,360
more happening yeah there is a war I'm

263
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,100
sorry I got distracted by Abram's drift

264
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,600
I think Abram's drifts are more uh

265
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,779
important they are really cool though

266
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,760
yeah like when Abrams gets sliding

267
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,740

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,740
the friendly thinking it was an enemy

271
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,519
because you weren't paying attention

272
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,959
